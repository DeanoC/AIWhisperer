# Manual Model Continuation Test Report

Generated: 2025-06-02T07:36:02.674915

Models tested: 3

## Model Capabilities Summary

| Model | Provider | Multi-tool | Expected Behavior |
|-------|----------|------------|------------------|
| openai/gpt-4o-mini | openai | True | Can call multiple tools in one response |
| anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-latest | anthropic | True | Can call multiple tools in one response |
| google/gemini-1.5-flash | google | False | Calls one tool per response, needs continuation |

## Test Scenarios

### openai/gpt-4o-mini

**Multi-step task**
- Description: List RFCs then create a new one
- Expected continuation: False

**Single tool call**
- Description: Just list files
- Expected continuation: False

### anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-latest

**Multi-step task**
- Description: List RFCs then create a new one
- Expected continuation: False

**Single tool call**
- Description: Just list files
- Expected continuation: False

### google/gemini-1.5-flash

**Multi-step task**
- Description: List RFCs then create a new one
- Expected continuation: True

**Single tool call**
- Description: Just list files
- Expected continuation: False

## Key Findings

1. **Multi-tool models** (OpenAI, Anthropic):
   - Can execute multiple tool calls in a single response
   - No continuation needed for multi-step operations
   - More efficient for complex workflows

2. **Single-tool models** (Google Gemini):
   - Execute one tool call per response
   - Require continuation for multi-step operations
   - Need explicit continuation handling in the session manager

## Implementation Notes

The continuation system in `StatelessSessionManager` should:
1. Detect when a model needs continuation (single-tool models)
2. Automatically continue the conversation after tool execution
3. Track continuation depth to prevent infinite loops
4. Send progress notifications during multi-step operations
