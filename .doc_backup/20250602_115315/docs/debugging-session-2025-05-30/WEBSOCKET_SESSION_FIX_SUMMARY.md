# WebSocket Session Management Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The root cause of the chat buffering and persona loss was **orphaned WebSocket sessions** caused by:
1. Browser windows being closed abruptly (as you discovered!)
2. No cleanup when WebSocket connections disconnect
3. AI responses continuing to stream to closed connections
4. Empty responses not being stored to context, causing consecutive user messages

## Symptoms
1. Messages require a "flush" message to appear (buffering effect)
2. Alice loses her persona after initial messages
3. Empty responses (`response_length=0`) in logs
4. "Cannot call 'send' once a close message has been sent" errors

## Root Cause Analysis
When a browser window closes:
- The WebSocket connection terminates
- The server doesn't clean up the session association
- The AI continues streaming responses to the closed WebSocket
- This results in empty responses being returned
- Empty responses aren't stored to context, creating invalid message sequences
- The next message sees two consecutive user messages and loses context

## Fixes Applied

### 1. WebSocket Cleanup (`interactive_server/main.py`)
Added cleanup when WebSocket connections close:
```python
# Cleanup session when WebSocket closes
try:
    if websocket in session_manager.websocket_sessions:
        session_id = session_manager.websocket_sessions[websocket]
        # Remove the WebSocket association
        del session_manager.websocket_sessions[websocket]
        # Clear the WebSocket reference in the session
        if session_id in session_manager.sessions:
            session = session_manager.sessions[session_id]
            session.websocket = None
```

### 2. Safe Streaming (`interactive_server/stateless_session_manager.py`)
Added checks before sending to WebSocket:
```python
# Check if WebSocket is still connected
if self.websocket is None:
    logger.warning(f"WebSocket disconnected for session {session_id}, skipping chunk")
    return
```

### 3. Context Integrity (`ai_whisperer/ai_loop/stateless_ai_loop.py`)
Always store assistant messages to prevent consecutive user messages:
```python
# Empty response - store a placeholder to maintain context integrity
if not response_data.get('response') and not response_data.get('tool_calls'):
    logger.warning(f"Empty response detected, storing placeholder to maintain context")
    assistant_message['content'] = "[Assistant response unavailable due to connection interruption]"
```

## Testing
Created `test_session_cleanup.py` to verify:
1. Abrupt disconnection handling
2. Session persistence after reconnect
3. Context preservation

## Recommendations
1. Always close browser tabs properly when done
2. Consider implementing session timeouts
3. Add reconnection handling in the frontend
4. Monitor for orphaned sessions periodically

The fixes ensure that:
- Sessions are properly cleaned up when connections close
- AI responses don't try to stream to closed connections
- Context integrity is maintained even with connection issues
- Alice (and other agents) maintain their personas across disconnections
