  "instructions": [
    "Carefully review the code in `src/ai_whisperer/agent_handlers/code_generation.py` to identify the specific sections of code that constitute the core AI interaction loop (e.g., sending prompts, receiving responses, processing responses, handling retries, etc.).",
    "Analyze the identified AI loop logic to determine the best way to encapsulate it. Consider options like creating a dedicated function, a class, or a module.",
    "Based on the `docs/context_manager_design.md`, plan how the refactored AI loop component will receive and utilize the context provided by the `ContextManager`. This includes understanding what information the AI loop needs from the context and how it will access it.",
    "Outline the specific code modifications required in `src/ai_whisperer/agent_handlers/code_generation.py` to replace the current inline AI loop logic with calls to the new reusable AI loop component and to integrate with the `ContextManager`.",
    "Document the entire refactoring plan, including the identified AI loop logic, the chosen encapsulation approach, the integration strategy with the `ContextManager`, and the necessary code changes in `docs/ai_loop_refactor_plan.md`. Ensure the document is clear and detailed enough for implementation."
