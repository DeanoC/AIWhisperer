  "instructions": [
    "Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the AIWhisperer project.",
    "Run the integration tests specifically designed for the DelegateManager integration using pytest. The command should target the test file: `pytest tests/integration/test_delegate_manager_integration.py`.",
    "Ensure all tests within `tests/integration/test_delegate_manager_integration.py` pass without errors.",
    "Manually execute the following CLI commands in your terminal:",
    "- `python src/aiwhisperer/cli.py initial_plan`",
    "- `python src/aiwhisperer/cli.py overview_plan`",
    "- `python src/aiwhisperer/cli.py list_models`",
    "Observe the output of each command. Verify that the output is consistent with expected behavior and that the underlying logic appears to be handled by the DelegateManager (e.g., observing delegate-specific logging or behavior if implemented).",
    "If the DelegateManager implementation includes pause/end functionality for tasks, manually test these features by starting a task that utilizes the DelegateManager and attempting to pause and then end it via the CLI or any implemented interface."
