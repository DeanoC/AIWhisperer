  "description": "Implement the planned refactoring to integrate DelegateManager into the target modules and CLI commands.",
  "instructions": [
    "Review the refactoring plan in `docs/delegate_manager_refactoring_plan.md` to understand the intended changes and the single setup location for DelegateManager.",
    "Locate the initial setup point for DelegateManager as defined in the plan.",
    "Modify the code at the designated single setup location to initialize the DelegateManager instance.",
    "Navigate to `src/aiwhisperer/cli.py`.",
    "Identify the command handlers that require access to user-facing message delegation.",
    "Modify the relevant command handlers in `src/aiwhisperer/cli.py` to accept the DelegateManager instance as an argument or through an appropriate mechanism (e.g., dependency injection).",
    "Ensure the DelegateManager instance initialized at the single setup location is passed to these command handlers.",
    "Open `src/aiwhisperer/plan_runner.py`, `src/aiwhisperer/initial_plan_generator.py`, `src/aiwhisperer/overview_plan_generator.py`, and `src/aiwhisperer/list_models.py`.",
    "Modify the relevant classes or functions within these files to accept the DelegateManager instance.",
    "Identify existing `print` statements, logging calls (if used for user-facing messages), or other direct output mechanisms intended for the user in these files.",
    "Replace these direct output mechanisms with calls to the appropriate methods on the DelegateManager instance (e.g., `delegate_manager.message(...)`).",
    "Implement the mechanism for automatic ending or pausing of command execution using the DelegateManager, as detailed in the refactoring plan.",
    "Review `src/aiwhisperer/execution_engine.py` and `src/aiwhisperer/ai_loop.py`.",
    "Assess if these files need modifications to align with the new DelegateManager setup and passing scheme.",
    "If necessary, adjust `src/aiwhisperer/execution_engine.py` and `src/aiwhisperer/ai_loop.py` to correctly receive and potentially pass the DelegateManager instance.",
    "Ensure all code changes strictly follow the refactoring plan outlined in `docs/delegate_manager_refactoring_plan.md`."
