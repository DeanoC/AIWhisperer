    "Provide clear examples demonstrating how to specify and override paths using both the config file and CLI.",
    "Ensure the document is well-structured, uses clear headings and formatting, and is easy for a new contributor to understand.",
    "Review the `project_dev/rfc/sort_out_paths.md` and `docs/path_management_design.md` for context and design decisions related to path management."
