  "description": "Implement the integration tests for the path management system.",
  "instructions": [
    "Open the file `tests/integration/test_path_management_integration.py`.",
    "Import necessary modules, including `pytest`, `os`, `tempfile`, `shutil`, and components from `src.ai_whisperer.path_management`, `src.ai_whisperer.config`, and `src.ai_whisperer.cli`.",
    "Implement test functions within the `test_path_management_integration.py` file.",
    "For each test case, use `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` to create a temporary directory that will serve as the test environment.",
    "Within the temporary directory, simulate file operations (e.g., creating files, directories) that the path management functions will interact with.",
    "Write tests that verify the behavior of path management functions when using default paths.",
    "Write tests that verify the behavior of path management functions when paths are specified via a configuration file (using a temporary config file and mocking `src.ai_whisperer.config.load_config` if necessary).",
    "Write tests that verify the behavior of path management functions when paths are specified via command-line arguments (using mocking or other techniques to simulate CLI arguments and their parsing in `src.ai_whisperer.cli`).",
    "Ensure tests cover scenarios where paths are absolute and relative.",
    "Verify that files are created/accessed in the expected locations based on the default, config, and CLI specified paths.",
    "Use assertions to check the existence of files/directories, their content (if applicable), and any return values from the path management functions.",
    "Ensure that the temporary directories and their contents are automatically cleaned up after each test using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` or appropriate teardown methods.",
    "Run the integration tests using `pytest tests/integration/test_path_management_integration.py` to verify they pass."

  "constraints": [
    "All implemented tests must pass when executed with pytest.",
    "Tests must not leave any temporary files or directories behind after execution.",
    "Tests should be isolated and not depend on the state of other tests.",
    "Avoid modifying files outside of the temporary directories created for testing."

  "validation_criteria": [
    "The file `tests/integration/test_path_management_integration.py` contains new test functions.",
    "Executing `pytest tests/integration/test_path_management_integration.py` results in all existing and newly added tests passing.",
    "The tests cover the path resolution logic for default, config, and CLI specified paths.",
    "Temporary directories and files are properly handled and cleaned up by the tests."
