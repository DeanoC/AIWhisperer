      "Create a new test file `tests/unit/test_main_list_models.py` if it doesn't exist, or add tests to it if it does.",
      "Write unit or integration tests within `tests/unit/test_main_list_models.py` that specifically target the `list_models` functionality in `src/ai_whisperer/main.py`.",
      "Ensure the tests cover the following scenarios:",
      "- Verify that the `list_models` function correctly parses the `--output-csv` command-line argument when it is provided.",
      "- Test that when `--output-csv` is present, the `list_models` function calls the necessary internal logic (potentially mocking API calls) to fetch detailed model information.",
      "- Write tests to confirm that the fetched detailed model data is correctly formatted into a CSV string or a structure that can be easily written as CSV.",
      "- Include tests that simulate writing the generated CSV data to the file path specified by the `--output-csv` argument. Use mocking to avoid actual file system operations during the test run.",
      "- Add tests to ensure that when the `--output-csv` argument is NOT provided, the `list_models` function falls back to its original behavior of printing a concise list of models to the console (standard output).",
      "Use mock objects (e.g., from `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`) to simulate the behavior of the OpenRouter API and file system operations, providing controlled mock data for model details.",
      "Ensure the tests are well-structured, readable, and follow standard Python testing practices."

    "constraints": [
      "Tests must be placed in `tests/unit/test_main_list_models.py`.",
      "Tests should focus solely on the behavior related to the `--output-csv` argument and CSV output generation/handling.",
      "Avoid making actual API calls or writing to the file system during test execution by using mocking."

      "The file `tests/unit/test_main_list_models.py` contains test functions that specifically verify the parsing of the `--output-csv` CLI argument.",
