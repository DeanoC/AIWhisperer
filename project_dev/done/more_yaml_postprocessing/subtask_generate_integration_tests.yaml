  instructions: 'Generate an integration test file `tests/integration/test_postprocessing_pipeline.py`
    using pytest.


    These tests must verify the functionality of the complete `PostprocessingPipeline`,
    ensuring that all integrated steps (including indentation normalization, adding
    required fields, removing invalid fields, and handling basic syntax issues) work
    together correctly to process various YAML inputs.


    For each test case:

    1. Define an input YAML string that represents a specific scenario (e.g., missing
    indentation, missing required fields, presence of invalid fields, syntax errors).

    2. Define the expected output YAML string after the pipeline has processed the
    input.

    3. Instantiate the `PostprocessingPipeline`.

    4. Call the pipeline''s processing method with the input YAML.

    5. Assert that the actual output YAML matches the expected output YAML.


    Include test cases that specifically cover:

    - YAML with incorrect indentation that needs normalization.

    - YAML missing required fields that should be added by the pipeline.

    - YAML containing invalid fields that should be removed.

    - YAML with basic syntax issues (e.g., extra spaces, incorrect list formatting)
    that the pipeline should handle or correct.

    - A combination of the above scenarios in a single input YAML.

    - Valid YAML input that should pass through the pipeline unchanged.

    '
  constraints:
  - Follow standard Python testing practices using `pytest`.
  - Ensure tests are independent and can be run in any order.
  - Use clear and descriptive test function names.
  - Include comments where necessary to explain complex test cases or expected behavior.
  validation_criteria:
  - tests/integration/test_postprocessing_pipeline.py exists.
  - tests/integration/test_postprocessing_pipeline.py contains multiple integration
    test functions using `pytest`.
  - The tests cover scenarios for indentation normalization, adding required fields,
    removing invalid fields, and handling basic syntax issues.
  - The tests assert the final output YAML structure and content after pipeline processing.
