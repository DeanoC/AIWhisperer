  instructions: 'Edit the prompt files `prompts/orchestrator_default.md` and `prompts/subtask_generator_default.md`.


    Locate and remove any explicit instructions or constraints within the prompts
    that enforce strict YAML formatting rules. This includes directives related to
    specific indentation levels, quoting requirements, the ordering of fields, or
    any other instructions aimed solely at ensuring perfect YAML syntax in the AI''s
    raw output.


    Adjust the remaining instructions in both prompts to focus the AI on generating
    the correct *content* and *structure* according to the defined schemas (e.g.,
    the step schema for orchestrator_default.md). Clearly state that strict YAML formatting
    will be handled by a postprocessing pipeline and is not the AI''s primary concern
    during generation. Ensure the AI understands it should produce valid YAML *content*
    but doesn''t need to obsess over perfect formatting details.

    postprocessing.
