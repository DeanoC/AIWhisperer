    "Review `docs/directory_restriction_strategy.md` to fully understand the defined strategy.",
    "Identify the parts of the runner code (likely in `src/ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py` or related files) responsible for file system interactions (reading, writing, executing commands).",
    "Implement checks within the runner's file handling logic to ensure that all file operations are confined to the specified workspace and output directories.",
    "Ensure read access is granted only to the workspace directory.",
    "Ensure read and write access is granted only to the output directory.",
    "Implement a mechanism to pass the absolute paths of the workspace and output directories to the runner when they differ from the current working directory.",
    "Modify the runner's path resolution logic to correctly interpret '{workspace}' and '{output}' shortcuts, resolving them to the actual provided workspace and output directory paths.",
    "Refactor existing path handling code if necessary to support the new restriction and shortcut logic.",
    "Run the tests located in `tests/runner_directory_access_tests.py`.",
    "Debug and fix any issues until all tests in `tests/runner_directory_access_tests.py` pass."
