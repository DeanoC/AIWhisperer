      "Navigate to the root directory of the AIWhisperer project.",
      "Run the unit tests specifically for the AI interaction and file saving logic using a command like `pytest tests/unit/test_refine_ai_interaction.py`.",
      "Analyze the test results to ensure all tests within `tests/unit/test_refine_ai_interaction.py` pass without errors.",
      "Perform integration testing by executing the 'refine' command of the AIWhisperer tool with a dummy requirement file. Use a command similar to `python -m ai_whisperer.main refine --input_file path/to/dummy_requirement.md --mock_ai_response 'Mock AI refined content'`. Ensure the mock AI response is used to avoid actual API calls.",
      "After running the integration test, verify that the original dummy requirement file has been renamed, typically with an iteration number appended (e.g., `dummy_requirement.md.001`).",
      "Confirm that a new file has been created with the original filename (`dummy_requirement.md`) in the same directory.",
      "Open the newly created file (`dummy_requirement.md`) and verify that its content matches the mocked AI response provided during the integration test (`'Mock AI refined content'`).",
      "Optionally, perform manual testing with a custom prompt file and a real AI model (if configured) to further validate the end-to-end flow."

    "constraints": [
      "The validation must be performed within the AIWhisperer project environment.",
      "Unit tests must be executed using pytest.",
      "Integration testing should use a mocked AI response to ensure determinism and avoid external dependencies during this validation step."
    ],
    "validation_criteria": [
      "All unit tests located in `tests/unit/test_refine_ai_interaction.py` pass successfully.",
      "Integration testing confirms that running the 'refine' command with a dummy file results in the original file being correctly renamed with an iteration number.",
      "Integration testing confirms that running the 'refine' command with a dummy file results in a new file being created with the original filename, containing the mocked AI response.",
      "Manual testing with a custom prompt file and real AI model (if performed) confirms the expected behavior of the 'refine' command."
