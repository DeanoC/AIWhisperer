# Orchestration Plan: Implement "Store Cost and Tokens to AI Calls" Feature

This document outlines the plan for orchestrating the implementation of the "Store Cost and Tokens to AI Calls" feature. The process will follow the subtasks defined in [`project_dev/in_dev/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls/overview_store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls.json`](project_dev/in_dev/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls/overview_store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls.json:1).

## Overall Process

1.  **Subtask Delegation and Monitoring:**
    *   Subtasks will be processed one by one, respecting their `depends_on` field from the overview plan.
    *   For each subtask:
        *   The appropriate mode will be determined based on the subtask `type` (e.g., `analysis` -> `architect`, `test_generation` -> `code`, `file_edit` -> `code`, `planning` -> `architect`, `validation` -> `debug` or `code`, `documentation` -> `code` or `architect`).
        *   The subtask's specific JSON definition file will be read to get detailed instructions.
        *   The subtask will be delegated to the chosen mode using the `new_task` tool, providing the subtask instructions.
        *   Confirmation of subtask completion will be awaited.
        *   Upon successful completion, the `completed` field for that subtask in [`project_dev/in_dev/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls/overview_store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls.json`](project_dev/in_dev/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls/overview_store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls.json:1) will be updated. This may require a temporary switch to a mode capable of writing JSON files (e.g., `code` mode).

2.  **Test-First Enforcement:**
    *   Before any `file_edit` or `code_generation` subtask is initiated, it will be ensured that its corresponding `test_generation` subtask (as defined by `depends_on`) has been completed and the tests are in place.

3.  **Flow Diagram (Mermaid):**

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        Start((Start Feature Implementation)) --> A{Read Overview Plan};
        A --> B(Identify Next Pending Subtask);
        B -- No Uncompleted Subtasks --> End((Feature Complete));
        B -- Subtask Found --> C{Check Dependencies Met?};
        C -- No --> B;
        C -- Yes --> D{Determine Subtask Type};
        D --> E{Read Subtask Definition File};
        E --> F{Delegate to Appropriate Mode};
        F --> G{Await Subtask Completion};
        G -- Failed --> H_Fail(Handle Failure / Report to User);
        H_Fail --> B;
        G -- Succeeded --> H_Success(Update Overview: Mark Subtask as Completed);
        H_Success --> B;
    end
    ```

4.  **Updating Overview Document:**
    *   After each subtask is confirmed complete, the [`project_dev/in_dev/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls/overview_store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls.json`](project_dev/in_dev/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls/overview_store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls.json:1) file will be modified.
    *   This involves:
        1.  Reading the current content of the overview file.
        2.  Finding the JSON object for the completed subtask using its `subtask_id`.
        3.  Changing its `completed` field from `false` to `true`.
        4.  Writing the modified content back to the file.

## First Subtask

The first subtask to be addressed is `62f6986c-efc8-4107-a4f8-10d79850ccad` (type: `analysis`).
The instructions for this subtask are detailed in [`project_dev/in_dev/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls/subtask_62f6986c-efc8-4107-a4f8-10d79850ccad.json`](project_dev/in_dev/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls/subtask_62f6986c-efc8-4107-a4f8-10d79850ccad.json:1).
This subtask will be delegated to the `architect` mode.
