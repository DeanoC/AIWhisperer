  "description": "Update documentation to reflect the new cost and token tracking feature.",
  "instructions": [
    "Locate the appropriate documentation file(s) to update. 'docs/usage.md' is a likely candidate for general usage information.",
    "Add a new section or subsection clearly explaining the new cost and token tracking feature specifically for OpenRouter models.",
    "Within this section, state that cost and token usage information is now tracked for interactions using OpenRouter.",
    "Briefly explain how this information is internally handled or where it is stored currently (referencing 'src/ai_whisperer/state_management.py' might be too technical for end-user docs, focus on the user perspective if possible, e.g., 'This information is stored internally for potential future display or analysis').",
    "Ensure the language is clear, concise, and easily understandable by users.",
    "Review existing documentation (especially `docs/usage.md` or `docs/index.md`) to see if any other sections need subtle updates due to this new feature (e.g., a high-level description of features).",
    "If relevant diagrams exist (`docs` directory contains several other `.md` files which might reference diagrams), review them to see if an update is necessary, although this is less likely for a simple data tracking feature."
