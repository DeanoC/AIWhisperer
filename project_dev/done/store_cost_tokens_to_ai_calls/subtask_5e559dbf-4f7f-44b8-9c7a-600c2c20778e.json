    "Navigate to the integration test file: `tests/integration/test_ai_service_interaction_integration.py`.",
    "Examine the existing tests to determine if any cover the interaction flow sufficient for validating cost/token capture and storage. If a suitable test exists, modify it.",
    "If no suitable test exists, create a new integration test function within `test_ai_service_interaction_integration.py`.",
    "The new or modified test should simulate a basic AI interaction using the updated `ai_service_interaction.py` code.",
    "Configure the test to use a mock AI service response that includes simulated cost and token information.",
    "After the simulated interaction, access the state managed by `state_management.py` (specifically, the message history).",
    "Assertions should be added to verify that the cost and token data from the mock response is correctly extracted and stored alongside the message in the message history.",
    "Ensure the test uses a test configuration that enables logging and monitoring to help debug if needed.",
    "Run the specific integration test (`pytest tests/integration/test_ai_service_interaction_integration.py::test_function_name`)."
