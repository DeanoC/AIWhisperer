  "description": "Update AI service interaction code to extract cost and token information from OpenRouter responses.",
  "instructions": [
    "Open the file `src/ai_whisperer/ai_service_interaction.py`.",
    "Locate the method responsible for handling responses from the OpenRouter API.",
    "Identify the structure of the OpenRouter response data, paying attention to where cost and token information is located.",
    "Add code to safely access and extract the 'cost', 'input_tokens', and 'output_tokens' fields from the response.",
    "Implement error handling or checks to gracefully handle cases where these fields might be missing in responses (although primarily focused on OpenRouter for this task, prepare for future flexibility).",
    "Store the extracted cost and token information effectively, ensuring it is associated with the specific AI call.",
    "Ensure the modifications integrate seamlessly with the existing logic for handling different AI service responses.",
    "Run the test suite using `pytest` to confirm that the new tests related to cost/token extraction in `tests/unit/test_ai_service_interaction.py` now pass, along with all other existing tests."

    "The changes must maintain compatibility with all existing AI service interaction functions and expected response structures from other services.",
    "Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary and approved."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All unit tests in `tests/unit/test_ai_service_interaction.py` pass successfully, including the newly added tests for cost and token extraction.",
    "When running the code with a simulated or actual OpenRouter response, the `cost`, `input_tokens`, and `output_tokens` are correctly extracted and available.",
    "No existing functionality is broken by the changes."
