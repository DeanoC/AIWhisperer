  "instructions": [
    "Open the unit test file located at `tests/unit/test_state_management.py`.",
    "Locate or create a test class related to message history or state updates.",
    "Add new test methods within this class (or a new class if appropriate) specifically designed to test the scenario where cost, input_tokens, and output_tokens are included when adding an AI message interaction to the state.",
    "These test cases should simulate the `add_ai_message_interaction` or a similar function being called with message content, cost, input tokens, and output tokens.",
    "The tests should assert or verify that the state object, specifically the stored message or interaction entry, accurately contains the passed cost, input_tokens, and output_tokens values alongside the message content.",
    "Reference the design document `docs/cost_token_storage_design.md` to ensure the test cases align with the planned data structure and storage mechanism.",
    "Ensure that these new tests are structured to verify the *storage* of this data, not the calculation or retrieval (those will be handled by separate tests).",
    "Run the `tests/unit/test_state_management.py` file using pytest or your preferred test runner (e.g., `pytest tests/unit/test_state_management.py`).",
    "Crucially, observe and confirm that these newly added tests *fail*. This is the expected outcome because the actual state management logic to store cost and token data has not yet been implemented."
