  "description": "Generate test cases for the integration of thread-safe delegates into the execution engine.",
  "instructions": [
    "Navigate to the `tests/execution_engine` directory.",
    "Create a new Python file named `test_delegates.py` if it doesn't already exist.",
    "Inside `test_delegates.py`, import necessary modules, including the thread-safe delegate implementation (`project_dev/notes/thread_safe_delegates.py`) and potentially components of the execution engine (though these might be stubs initially).",
    "Define a test class, e.g., `TestExecutionEngineDelegates`, inheriting from `unittest.TestCase` or `pytest` style.",
    "Implement test methods within the class to cover the following scenarios:",
    "- **Adding Delegates:** Test that delegates can be successfully added to the execution engine's delegate management system.",
    "- **Removing Delegates:** Test that delegates can be successfully removed.",
    "- **Triggering Events:** Test that when an event is triggered, all currently registered delegates are notified.",
    "- **Thread Safety (Adding/Removing):** Create tests that simulate multiple threads concurrently adding and removing delegates to ensure no race conditions or data corruption occur.",
    "- **Thread Safety (Triggering):** Create tests that simulate multiple threads triggering events simultaneously to ensure all delegates are notified correctly and thread-safely.",
    "- **Control Flow Methods:** Add tests for delegate methods related to execution control, such as `pause()`, `resume()`, and `stop()`, verifying that the execution engine correctly interacts with these methods.",
    "For the execution engine interaction tests, create minimal stub classes or mock objects to represent the execution engine components that interact with the delegates. This allows testing the delegate integration logic in isolation.",
    "Ensure tests are structured clearly and use appropriate assertion methods.",
    "Add comments explaining the purpose of each test case, especially for complex thread-safe scenarios.",
    "Save the `test_delegates.py` file."

    "Tests must be written in Python.",
    "Tests must be thread-safe, meaning they should not introduce race conditions or rely on specific thread execution order.",
    "Tests should cover the core functionality of adding, removing, and triggering delegates.",
    "Tests must explicitly verify the thread-safe behavior of the delegate system.",
    "Tests must cover the interaction between the execution engine (or its stubs) and the delegate control flow methods (pause, resume, stop).",
    "The output `test_delegates.py` must be a valid Python file containing test cases.",
    "Avoid implementing the actual execution engine integration logic in this subtask; focus solely on generating the test cases and necessary stubs."
