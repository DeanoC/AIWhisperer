  "instructions": [
    "Create a new Python file `tests/ai_loop/test_delegates.py`.",
    "Import necessary modules, including the thread-safe delegate system and the AI loop components (even if they are stubs at this point).",
    "Define a test class, e.g., `TestAIDelegateIntegration`.",
    "Implement test methods within the class to cover the following scenarios:",
    "- Test adding a delegate to the AI loop's delegate system.",
    "- Test removing a delegate from the AI loop's delegate system.",
    "- Test that delegates are triggered correctly when an AI prompt event occurs within the AI loop.",
    "- Test that delegates are triggered correctly when an AI return event occurs within the AI loop.",
    "- Implement tests using multiple threads to verify that adding, removing, and triggering delegates in the AI loop context is thread-safe.",
    "- For thread-safety tests, use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., locks, events) to simulate concurrent access.",
    "- Create minimal stub implementations or mock objects for the AI loop and delegate components as needed to allow the tests to run and fail gracefully.",
    "- Ensure test cases assert expected outcomes, such as delegates being called, data being passed correctly, and no race conditions occurring."
