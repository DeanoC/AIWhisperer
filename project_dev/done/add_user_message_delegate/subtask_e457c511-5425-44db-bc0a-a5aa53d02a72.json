    "Navigate to the project root directory if not already there.",
    "Ensure the test environment is set up and dependencies are installed (e.g., run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).",

    "Specifically verify that tests related to the user message delegate (`tests/test_user_message_delegate.py`) pass.",
    "Run the application manually using the command line, ensuring the user message delegate is active.",
    "Execute different commands or scenarios within the application that trigger user messages.",
    "Visually inspect the console output to confirm that user messages are displayed with the expected ANSI coloring.",
    "Verify that no internal log messages (e.g., debug, info) are printed to the console during manual testing.",
    "Review the documentation files, particularly those related to user messages or delegates, to ensure they accurately reflect the implemented functionality and usage.",
    "Confirm that the documentation is complete and easy to understand."
