  "instructions": [
    "Locate all instances of direct user-facing output (e.g., `print()`, logging to console) within the `src/ai_whisperer` directory.",
    "Replace these direct output calls with calls to the user message delegate, ensuring appropriate delegate methods are used for different message types (e.g., info, warning, error).",
    "Configure the logging system to ensure that log messages are written to a file but are explicitly prevented from appearing on the console.",
    "In the main application entry point or initialization code, instantiate the `BasicOutputTest` class and register it with the delegate manager as the default user message delegate implementation."

    "Examine the modified code files within `src/ai_whisperer` to confirm that direct output calls have been replaced by calls to the user message delegate.",
