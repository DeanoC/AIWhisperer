    "Open the file `src/ai_whisperer/ai_service_interaction.py`.",
    "Identify the function or method responsible for making API calls to Openrouter.",
    "Import the `ToolRegistry` class from `src/ai_whisperer/tools/tool_registry.py`.",
    "Instantiate the `ToolRegistry` within the AI interaction logic.",
    "Call a method on the `ToolRegistry` instance to get a list of all registered tools.",
    "For each tool obtained from the registry, access its Openrouter API definition.",
    "Construct a list of these Openrouter tool definitions.",
    "Modify the Openrouter API request payload to include a `tools` parameter.",
    "Set the value of the `tools` parameter to the list of Openrouter tool definitions.",
    "Update the code that processes the AI's response to handle potential tool calls.",
    "This might involve checking the response for a `tool_calls` field and processing its contents (though the execution of the tool call itself will be handled elsewhere)."
