  "instructions": [
    "Review the tool interface design (docs/tool_interface_design.md) and tool management design (docs/tool_management_design.md) to understand how tools are expected to be used and managed within the system.",
    "Based on the designs, outline a comprehensive testing strategy specifically for verifying the correct identification, selection, and usage of AI tools by the AI service.",
    "Detail the approach for implementing mocked tests. These tests should simulate the AI's interaction with tools and the tool's responses without executing the actual tool code or involving a real AI service. Focus on testing the system's logic for handling tool calls and processing simulated tool outputs.",
    "Detail the approach for implementing integration tests. These tests should involve a real AI service (Openrouter) and execute the actual tool code. Outline how these tests will verify the end-to-end flow: AI identifying and calling a tool, the system executing the tool, and the AI correctly processing the tool's output.",
    "For both mocked and integration tests, clearly define the criteria for success. This should include specific examples of what constitutes correct behavior, such as the AI selecting the appropriate tool for a given prompt, the tool receiving the correct arguments, the tool producing the expected output format, and the AI correctly incorporating the tool's output into its response.",
    "Document the designed testing strategy in docs/tool_testing_strategy.md."
