# Executive Summary: Migration from YAML to JSON

## Overview

This document provides an executive summary of the plan to migrate the AI Whisperer project from YAML to JSON as the structured output format. The migration is motivated by several issues with the current YAML implementation:

1. YAML's free-form nature is hard to condition
2. The current tool is broken due to YAML parsing issues
3. A more structured format like JSON would help development
4. The postprocessing system is currently focused on YAML and needs modification

## Key Components Affected

The migration affects several key components of the project:

1. **Orchestrator**: Generates initial task plans and coordinates subtask generation
2. **SubtaskGenerator**: Generates detailed subtask definitions
3. **Postprocessing Pipeline**: Processes AI output to fix issues and ensure proper structure
4. **Tests**: Verify the correct behavior of all components

## Migration Strategy

We recommend a **direct approach** to the migration, consisting of the following phases:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Utilities (Week 1)
- Create JSON schemas for task plans and subtasks
- Implement JSON validation utilities
- Create JSON-specific postprocessing steps

### Phase 2: Core Components (Week 2-3)
- Update the Orchestrator to output JSON only
- Update the SubtaskGenerator to output JSON only
- Update prompt templates for JSON generation

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Week 3-4)
- Create and run tests for the JSON implementation
- Replace existing YAML tests with JSON tests
- Run all tests to ensure everything works
- Perform manual testing with real examples

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 4)
- Deploy the JSON-only implementation
- Update documentation to reflect the JSON format
- Monitor for issues and provide support

## Key Benefits

The migration to JSON offers several key benefits:

1. **Strict Structure**: JSON enforces a stricter structure than YAML, reducing parsing errors
2. **No Indentation Sensitivity**: JSON doesn't rely on indentation for structure
3. **Better Library Support**: JSON parsing is more standardized across programming languages
4. **Easier Validation**: JSON Schema validation is more widely supported
5. **Consistent Quoting**: JSON has consistent rules for quoting strings

## Breaking Changes

Since we're taking a direct approach without backward compatibility, the following breaking changes will occur:

1. All output files will be in JSON format instead of YAML
2. Existing YAML files will need to be manually converted to JSON
3. Code that expects YAML output will need to be updated to handle JSON
4. The postprocessing pipeline will only handle JSON format

## Risk Mitigation

To mitigate risks associated with the migration, we will:

1. Implement comprehensive testing at each phase
2. Have a rollback plan ready
3. Monitor the system during and after migration
4. Communicate changes to users and provide support
5. Update documentation to reflect changes

## Conclusion

The migration from YAML to JSON is a significant change that requires careful planning and execution. By taking a direct approach with thorough testing, we can implement the migration quickly and efficiently. While this approach will cause some disruption due to breaking changes, the long-term benefits of improved reliability, better error handling, and a more structured output format will significantly outweigh the short-term costs of the migration. The simplified codebase without dual format support will also be easier to maintain going forward.
