# Thread-Safe Delegates Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a thread-safe delegate system in Python. The system allows an object running an execution loop to provide hooks that other objects on different threads can connect to. This enables loose coupling between components, making it easier to debug and modify the execution loop without changing its core functionality.

## Core Components

### 1. Delegate Manager

The central component will be a `DelegateManager` class that handles registration and invocation of delegates. This class will:

- Maintain a thread-safe collection of registered delegates
- Provide methods to register and unregister delegates
- Include thread synchronization mechanisms to ensure safe access from multiple threads
- Support different types of delegates (e.g., notification delegates, control delegates)

### 2. Delegate Types

We will implement two primary types of delegates:

- **Notification Delegates**: One-way communication from the execution loop to observers
- **Control Delegates**: Two-way communication allowing observers to influence the execution loop

### 3. Thread Synchronization

To ensure thread safety, we will use:

- `threading.Lock` for protecting access to the delegate collections
- `threading.Event` for signaling between threads when needed
- Thread-safe data structures for storing delegate references

## Delegate Interface

Delegates will be implemented using callable objects (functions, methods, or classes with `__call__`). This approach provides flexibility while maintaining a simple interface.

### Notification Delegate Signature

```python
def notification_delegate(sender, event_type, event_data):
    # Handle notification
    pass
```

### Control Delegate Signature

```python
def control_delegate(sender, control_type):
    # Process control request
    return result  # Boolean or other value depending on control type
```

## Pause Functionality

The pause functionality will be implemented as a special control delegate:

1. The execution loop will check at the beginning of each iteration if any pause delegates are registered
2. If registered, it will invoke all pause delegates and collect their responses
3. If any delegate returns `True`, the execution loop will pause

## Thread Safety Considerations

- All delegate collections will be protected by locks during modification
- Delegate invocation will be done on a copy of the collection to avoid holding locks during execution
- Delegates themselves should be designed to be thread-safe if they access shared state

## Usage Pattern

```python
# In the execution loop class
self.delegates = DelegateManager()

# In the execution loop
def run(self):
    while not self.should_stop:
        # Check if should pause
        if self.delegates.invoke_control("pause"):
            time.sleep(0.1)  # Small delay when paused
            continue
            
        # Perform execution step
        result = self.execute_step()
        
        # Notify observers
        self.delegates.invoke_notification("step_completed", result)
```

This design ensures loose coupling between the execution loop and observers while maintaining thread safety and providing the requested pause functionality.
