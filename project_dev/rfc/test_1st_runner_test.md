# Successfully run our 1st_runner_test plan

We have a full test in tests\1st_runner_test\current_test_plan
We now need to ensure the run system it complete, works and succesfully executes this plan.

## Goal

We have a test that does a full integration test (include actual servers and AI) that runs the 1st_runner_test and checks it succeeds.

We also have a test that runs it via command line, to test that the user facing part works successfully.

In both cases we are not changing the plan itself, only that our plan runner performs succesfully.
