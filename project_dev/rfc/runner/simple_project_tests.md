# We want some tests to stress the runner capability of AI Whisperer

The first tests should be creating simple code projects, all seperate with a git repo and the normal github files (README etc.)
The should follow a Test-first Design Driven methodology.

As these are tests for AI whisperer, the result should just be requirement markdown documents in a test\simple_project folder.

Do NOT make the projects themselves, only the requirement markdown files (like this)

## These should include 3 projects from scratch that can be tests and run with the correct output

a. A simple python 3 hello world app
b. A simple web javascript hellow world project
c. A simple C hello world project

## Some feature requests (on branch) to the projects in a, b and c.

1. For the python 3 hello world app made in a. It should add a input from the user and echo it to the screen
2. For the python 3 hello world app made in a. A simple text adventure, like early games like Adventure/Zork
3. For the python 3 hello world app made in a. A simple AI chat program that send the input + previous to an AI via openrouter
4. For the javascript hello world in b. A simple static website with buttons and icons in a retro 1990s era website
5. For the javascript hello world in b. A modern web app with a 3D spinning globe
6. For the simple C hello world projects. A Sinclear ZX81 computer emulator that runs BASIC.
