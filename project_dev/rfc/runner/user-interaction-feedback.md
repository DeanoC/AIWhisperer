# User Interaction/Feedback

## Description
The User Interaction/Feedback feature provides a mechanism to ask for user clarification or confirmation at critical decision points if the AI or plan indicates uncertainty, and reports progress and final results to the user. This feature is optional but recommended.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want the runner to ask for user input when needed so that I can provide guidance or confirm actions.
- As a developer, I want the runner to report progress and results so that I can stay informed about the execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The runner can prompt the user for input when specified in the plan.
- The runner can report progress and results to the user via console or log.
