# Terminal Interaction Module

## Description
The Terminal Interaction Module executes shell commands in a secure and controlled environment, captures standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) from commands, provides input to interactive commands if necessary (with safeguards), and manages working directories for command execution.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want the runner to execute shell commands so that I can automate command-line tasks as part of the plan.
- As a developer, I want the runner to capture command output so that I can use it in subsequent steps of the plan.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The runner can execute a specified shell command in a secure environment.
- The runner can capture the stdout and stderr of the command.
- The runner can set the working directory for the command.
