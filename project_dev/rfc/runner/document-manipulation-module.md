# Document Manipulation Module

## Description
The Document Manipulation Module reads content from existing files (source code, markdown, configuration files, etc.), writes new files or overwrites existing ones, and performs in-place modifications to files, such as inserting, deleting, or replacing text/code blocks based on AI instructions or plan steps. It handles various file formats, primarily text-based (code, JSON, MD).

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want the runner to read and write files so that I can automate document editing as part of the plan.
- As a developer, I want the runner to perform in-place file modifications so that I can update code or configuration files automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The runner can read the content of a specified file.
- The runner can write content to a new or existing file.
- The runner can insert, delete, or replace text in a file based on instructions.
