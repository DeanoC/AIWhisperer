# Execution Engine

## Description
The Execution Engine is responsible for sequentially or concurrently (if applicable and safe) executing tasks defined in the plan. It manages the state of execution for each task (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed, failed) and supports conditional logic or branching if specified in the plan (advanced feature).

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want the runner to execute tasks sequentially or concurrently so that I can efficiently implement the plan.
- As a developer, I want the runner to manage the state of each task so that I can track progress and handle failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The runner can execute tasks in the order specified in the plan.
- The runner can manage the state of each task (pending, in-progress, completed, failed).
- The runner can handle conditional logic in the plan (if specified).
