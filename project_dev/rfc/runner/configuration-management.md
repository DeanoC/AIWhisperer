# Configuration Management

## Description
The Configuration Management feature utilizes AIWhisperer's existing `config.yaml` for API keys, model preferences, and potentially runner-specific settings.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want the runner to use AIWhisperer's existing configuration so that I can manage settings in one place.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The runner uses the `config.yaml` file for API keys and model preferences.
- The runner can read runner-specific settings from the configuration.
