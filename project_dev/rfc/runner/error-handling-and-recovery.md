# Error Handling and Recovery

## Description
The Error Handling and Recovery feature robustly handles errors from AI services, file operations, and terminal commands. It implements retry mechanisms for transient errors, provides clear error messages and context, and allows for defined recovery strategies or manual intervention prompts if a task fails critically.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want the runner to handle errors gracefully so that I can recover from failures and continue execution.
- As a developer, I want the runner to provide clear error messages so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The runner can detect and handle errors from AI services, file operations, and terminal commands.
- The runner can retry failed operations based on configuration.
- The runner can report errors with sufficient context for debugging.
