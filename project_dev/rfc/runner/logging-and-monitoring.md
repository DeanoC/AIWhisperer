# Logging and Monitoring

## Description
The Logging and Monitoring feature provides detailed logging of all actions performed by the runner (plan steps, AI calls, file operations, terminal commands). It logs successes, failures, and any significant events, and provides a way to monitor the progress of plan execution.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want the runner to log all actions so that I can monitor progress and debug issues.
- As a developer, I want the runner to provide a way to monitor execution so that I can track the status of long-running plans.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The runner logs all actions to a file or console.
- The runner provides a way to view the current status of plan execution.
