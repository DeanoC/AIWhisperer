# Logging and Monitoring

## Description
The Logging and Monitoring feature provides detailed logging of all actions performed by the runner (plan steps, AI calls, file operations, terminal commands). It logs successes, failures, and any significant events, and provides a way to monitor the progress of plan execution.

Each step may contain multiple interaction with the AIs and thse needs reflecting in the monitoring.

This includes a running view of the interaction across all actions the AI running the plan, and a ability to pause, cancel and add for the user to add extra context as the AI works.

This should be initially a simple terminal based flow, but with the ability to improve the UI later including adding non terminal based UI

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want the runner to log all actions so that I can monitor progress and debug issues.
- As a developer, I want the runner to provide a way to monitor execution so that I can track the status of long-running plans.
- As a developer, I want the runner to understand what is happening as it happens.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The runner logs all actions to a file or console.
- The runner provides a way to view the current status of plan execution as it runs.
