# Plan Ingestion and Parsing

## Description

The Plan Ingestion and Parsing feature allows the runner to ingest a plan in JSON format, this will be driven by AI Whisperer overview_%NAME$.md plan, this contains steps and link to step (AKA subtasks).

This will provide the structure and execution order of the tasks and steps that needs to be ran.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want the runner to ingest and parse JSON plans so that I can automate the implementation of AI-generated plans.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The runner can read a JSON plan file.
- The runner can parse the JSON into an internal representation of tasks.
- The runner validates the JSON against a schema and reports errors if invalid.
