# Plan Ingestion and Parsing

## Description
The Plan Ingestion and Parsing feature allows the runner to ingest a plan in JSON format, consistent with AIWhisperer's current output, and parse it into an internal representation of tasks, sub-tasks, and actions.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want the runner to ingest and parse JSON plans so that I can automate the implementation of AI-generated plans.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The runner can read a JSON plan file.
- The runner can parse the JSON into an internal representation of tasks.
- The runner validates the JSON against a schema and reports errors if invalid.
