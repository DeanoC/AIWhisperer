# State Management

## Description
The State Management feature maintains the overall state of the feature implementation process across multiple steps and tasks. It stores intermediate results, file paths, and any context necessary for subsequent steps, and potentially supports checkpointing and resuming of plan execution.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want the runner to maintain state across tasks so that I can share data between steps and resume execution if interrupted.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The runner can store and retrieve intermediate results between tasks.
- The runner can save and load the execution state to resume a plan.
