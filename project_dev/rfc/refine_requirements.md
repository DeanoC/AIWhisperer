# Requirements Refinement
This document outlines a feature for the project, the need for an AI to assist refining and validating requirements.

## Problem Statement
The initial requirement document written in natural language is often ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent. 
This can lead to misunderstandings, to create a system that can refine these requirements using AI.

## Proposed Solution
Provide a CLI option that takes a requirement document, sends it to an AI, and receives a refined version of the requirement document.
It will rename the input file to `<filename>_iteratio<N>` and create a new file with the refined requirements. N will increment with each iteration.
Both input and output files will be in markdown format.
A custom prompt will be used to instruct the AI on how to refine the requirements, with a default prompt provided similar to existing prompts in the project.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a new CLI command for refining requirements.
2. Send the input file to the AI with the custom prompt.
3. Rename the input file to `<filename>_iteration<N>`, where N is the iteration number.
4. Read the AI's response and save it to the original filename.

## Notes
The system should be modular and allow for future extensions, such as:
Asking multiple AIs for their opinions on the requirements.
Using different prompts for different types of requirements.
