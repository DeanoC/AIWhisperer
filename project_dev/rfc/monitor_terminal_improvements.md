# Make the monitor terminal easy to understand

Split the screen into 3 horizontal segments. The center one should be wider than the other two. It should be mostly filled with the monitor, with a smaller command box at the bottom (not used yet).
The column to the left and right should display currently be empty.

Segments should be outlighted with ASCII art boxes
All non monitor output should be surpressd and not fill up the main terminal window

Different terminal events,levels etc, should be coloured. Json or string that contain json should be printed prettily with colours also
