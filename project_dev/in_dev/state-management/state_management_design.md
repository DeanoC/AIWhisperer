# Finalized State Management Design

## Purpose

This document provides the finalized design for the State Management feature of the AIWhisperer runner. The design has been updated to reflect the requirements of the Execution Engine.

## Scope and Limitations

This design covers the core concepts, data structures, and interfaces for storing and retrieving intermediate results and execution state. It assumes a file-based system for simplicity and ease of implementation.

## Data Persistence

The State Management feature will store intermediate results and execution state in a file-based system. The state will be saved in a JSON file, allowing for easy serialization and deserialization.

### Checkpointing and Resuming

The runner will periodically save the execution state to a file. If the execution is interrupted, the runner can resume from the last saved state by loading the state file.

## State Representation

The state will be represented using a Python dictionary with the following structure:

```python
state = {
    "tasks": {
        "task_id": {
            "status": "pending",  # or "in-progress", "completed", "failed"
            "result": {}  # intermediate results for the task
        }
    },
    "global_state": {
        "file_paths": [],  # paths to files generated during execution
        "other_context": {}  # any other context needed for subsequent steps
    }
}
```

This structure allows for tracking the status of each task and storing intermediate results and global context.

## Basic API Considerations

The State Management feature will provide the following methods:

1. `save_state(state, file_path)`: Saves the state dictionary to a JSON file at `file_path`.
2. `load_state(file_path)`: Loads the state from a JSON file at `file_path` and returns the state dictionary.
3. `update_task_status(state, task_id, status)`: Updates the status of a task in the state.
4. `store_task_result(state, task_id, result)`: Stores the intermediate result of a task in the state.
5. `get_task_result(state, task_id)`: Retrieves the intermediate result of a task from the state.
6. `update_global_state(state, key, value)`: Updates a key-value pair in the global state.
7. `get_global_state(state, key)`: Retrieves a value from the global state.

The Execution Engine will use these methods to interact with the State Management feature.

## Concurrency and Data Consistency

The State Management feature will use file locking to ensure data consistency when multiple processes access the state file concurrently. The `save_state` and `load_state` methods will acquire a lock on the state file to prevent concurrent access.

## Error Handling

The State Management feature will handle errors gracefully, ensuring that the state file is not corrupted in case of an error. The `save_state` method will write to a temporary file first and then rename it to the final state file to ensure atomicity.

## Conclusion

This finalized design for the State Management feature provides a robust foundation for storing and retrieving intermediate results and execution state. The design has been updated to reflect the requirements of the Execution Engine and includes considerations for concurrency and data consistency.
