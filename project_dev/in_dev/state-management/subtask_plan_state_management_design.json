      "Carefully read and understand the existing RFC documents related to State Management (project_dev/rfc/runner/state-management.md), Execution Engine (project_dev/rfc/runner/execution-engine.md), and Plan Ingestion and Parsing (project_dev/rfc/runner/plan-ingestion-and-parsing.md). Pay close attention to how these components interact and the requirements for state persistence.",
      "Based on the RFCs, propose a detailed design for the runner's state management system.",
      "Clearly define the structure of the data that needs to be stored as part of the runner's state. This should include information about the current task being executed, the overall plan progress, intermediate results from tasks, and any other relevant execution context.",
      "Specify the chosen mechanism for storing and retrieving the state. Consider options like using a simple JSON file for initial implementation, or discuss potential future options like a lightweight database if the RFCs suggest scalability needs (though prioritize the simplest solution that meets current RFC requirements). Justify your choice based on the project's current stage and requirements.",
      "Outline a clear and concise API for interacting with the state management system. This API should include functions for saving the current state, loading a previously saved state, and potentially updating specific parts of the state during execution.",
      "Consider potential implications for concurrent access to the state if the execution engine design suggests parallel task execution. While not explicitly required for the initial implementation, briefly note how the chosen storage mechanism might handle or need to handle concurrency in the future.",
      "Document the entire design proposal in the file `project_dev/in_dev/state-management/state_management_design.md`. Ensure the document is well-structured, easy to understand, and clearly addresses all the points outlined in these instructions."
    ],
    "constraints": [
      "The design must support storing intermediate results generated by individual tasks within a plan execution.",
      "The design must support saving the complete execution state of a running plan, allowing the runner to be stopped and resumed from the saved state.",
      "The initial implementation should prioritize simplicity and ease of development, aligning with the current project phase."
    ],
    "validation_criteria": [
      "The output file `project_dev/in_dev/state-management/state_management_design.md` must be created.",
      "The design document must clearly describe the chosen state storage mechanism (e.g., JSON file) and provide a rationale for the choice.",
      "The design document must clearly define the data structure used to represent the runner's state.",
      "The design document must outline a clear API with functions for saving and loading the state."
