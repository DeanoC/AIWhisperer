# Analysis Summary: Implementing AIWhisperer Runner for simple_country_test

This document summarizes the analysis of the existing AIWhisperer runner components and the `simple_country_test` setup, as a preliminary step towards making the test pass with a real AI connection.

**Analyzed Files:**

- [`./src/ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py`](./src/ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py)
- [`./tests/simple_run_test_country/run_test_plan.ps1`](./tests/simple_run_test_country/run_test_plan.ps1)
- [`./tests/simple_run_test_country/simple_run_test_country_aiwhisperer_config.json`](./tests/simple_run_test_country/simple_run_test_country_aiwhisperer_config.json)
- [`./project_dev/rfc/simple_run_test_country.md`](./project_dev/rfc/simple_run_test_country.md)

**Key Findings:**

1.  **Execution Engine (`execution_engine.py`):**
    *   The `ExecutionEngine` class is responsible for processing a plan, managing task states, and handling dependencies.
    *   It interacts with a `StateManager` and a `TerminalMonitor`.
    *   The core task execution logic resides in the `_execute_single_task` method. **Crucially, this method currently contains a placeholder that simulates task execution and returns a dummy result.** This is the primary area requiring modification to integrate with a real AI service.

2.  **Test Runner Script (`run_test_plan.ps1`):**
    *   This PowerShell script serves as the test harness for the `simple_country_test`.
    *   It handles the execution of the AIWhisperer runner (`src.ai_whisperer.main run`) with the specified plan and configuration files.
    *   It manages paths, creates the output directory, and includes an option to clean the `state.json` file.

3.  **Test Plan Configuration (`simple_run_test_country_aiwhisperer_config.json`):**
    *   This JSON file defines the sequence of steps for the `simple_country_test`.
    *   The plan includes steps for selecting a landmark, interacting with an AI to get country and capital information, and validating the AI's responses.
    *   Steps with `"agent_spec": {"type": "ai_interaction", ...}` are designed for AI interaction and will need to be connected to a real AI service.
    *   Steps with `"agent_spec": {"type": "validation", ...}` are in place to check the correctness of the AI's responses.

4.  **RFC Document (`simple_run_test_country.md`):**
    *   This document clarifies the objective of the `simple_country_test`: to provide a basic, real-world test of the AIWhisperer runner's integration with a real AI via Openrouter.
    *   It emphasizes testing plan execution, AI interaction (sending questions and receiving answers), validation, token context handling across turns, and streaming with Openrouter.
    *   It highlights the need for the validation steps to be flexible enough to handle variations in AI responses (e.g., different ways of referring to a country).

**Identified Gaps and Required Modifications:**

The primary gap identified is the simulated AI interaction within the `_execute_single_task` method of the `ExecutionEngine`. To make the `simple_country_test` pass with a real AI connection, the following modification is necessary:

*   **Implement Real AI Interaction:** The `_execute_single_task` method needs to be updated to dispatch tasks with `agent_spec.type == "ai_interaction"` to a component that can communicate with a real AI service (likely using the Openrouter backend). This involves sending the instructions and input artifacts to the AI and capturing the AI's response as the task result.

The existing validation steps and the test runner script appear to be correctly set up to handle the plan execution and validation once real AI responses are available. The plan structure in the configuration file also seems appropriate for the test's objective.

This analysis confirms that the path forward involves enhancing the `ExecutionEngine` to handle actual AI interactions for the relevant task types defined in the plan.
