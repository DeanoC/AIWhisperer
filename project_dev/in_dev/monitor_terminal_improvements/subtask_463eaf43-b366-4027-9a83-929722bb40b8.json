  "instructions": [
    "Carefully review the user requirements related to the terminal monitor layout.",
    "Document the specific requirements for splitting the terminal screen into 3 horizontal segments.",
    "Document the specific requirements for the relative widths of these segments, ensuring the center segment is the widest and the left/right segments are empty.",
    "Document the specific requirements for outlining each segment using ASCII art boxes.",
    "Document the specific requirements for suppressing non-monitor output to keep the monitor display clean.",
    "Document the specific requirements for coloring different types of terminal events, levels, JSON data, and plain strings.",
    "Investigate potential Python libraries or standard library modules that could be used to implement terminal manipulation features like screen splitting, cursor positioning, and coloring (e.g., `curses`, `colorama`, `rich`).",
    "Consider how the existing monitoring logic in `src/ai_whisperer/monitoring.py` might need to be adapted or extended to support this new terminal layout.",
    "Outline the necessary code changes at a high level, identifying which files or classes will likely be affected.",
    "Synthesize the findings into a markdown document located at `docs/monitor_terminal_analysis.md`."
