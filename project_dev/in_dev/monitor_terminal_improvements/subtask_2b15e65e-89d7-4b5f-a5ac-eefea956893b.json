    "Navigate to the root directory of the AIWhisperer project.",

    "Ensure all tests in `tests/unit/test_monitoring.py` and `tests/unit/test_terminal_monitor.py` pass.",
    "Manually run the application with the monitor enabled. If a specific CLI option exists for enabling the monitor, use that. Otherwise, identify and set the internal flag or configuration option that activates the terminal monitor display.",
    "Observe the terminal output carefully during the application run.",
    "Visually inspect the terminal output to confirm the following layout and rendering requirements:",
    "- The terminal screen is clearly divided into 3 distinct horizontal segments.",
    "- The central segment is visibly wider than the top and bottom segments.",
    "- ASCII art or similar characters are used to draw boxes or borders outlining each of the three segments.",
    "- Ensure that standard application output (non-monitor related) does not interfere with or clutter the main monitor display area.",
    "- Verify that different types of events and JSON data displayed within the monitor segments are rendered with appropriate and distinct color coding for readability and differentiation."
