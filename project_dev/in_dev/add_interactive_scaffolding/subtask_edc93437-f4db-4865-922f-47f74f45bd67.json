  "instructions": [
    "Review the requirement for the interactive session to outlast the AI compute session. Understand why this is necessary for the interactive CLI experience.",
    "Identify the key components within the AIWhisperer architecture responsible for managing the AI compute session and the user's interactive session. Pay attention to `ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py`, `ai_whisperer/cli.py`, and potentially `ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py`.",
    "Determine how the current process flow terminates after the AI computation (`ai_loop`) finishes. Identify the point where the interactive part (CLI) would typically exit.",
    "Research and propose mechanisms to keep the interactive part (the CLI process) alive and responsive after the AI computation thread or process completes.",
    "Consider the feasibility and implications of using separate threads for the interactive CLI interface and the AI computation process to allow independent lifecycles.",
    "Document the findings, including the identified components, the current termination points, the proposed approach for extending the interactive session duration, and the rationale for using separate threads, in the file `docs/interactive_session_duration_analysis.md`."
