  "instructions": [
    "Review the user requirements for adding a CLI interactive option. Consider how this new mode will differ from the existing non-interactive execution.",
    "Examine the current CLI parsing logic in `ai_whisperer/cli.py` to identify where and how a new argument for interactive mode should be added.",
    "Determine the best approach for propagating the interactive mode flag from the CLI parsing logic through the application's main execution flow (likely starting in `ai_whisperer/main.py` or `ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py`) to relevant components that would behave differently in interactive mode.",
    "Document the findings of the analysis, including the proposed CLI argument name, the required changes to the parsing logic, and the mechanism for passing the interactive flag, in the file `docs/interactive_cli_analysis.md`."

    "The file `docs/interactive_cli_analysis.md` proposes a clear method for passing the interactive flag through the application flow.",
    "The analysis in `docs/interactive_cli_analysis.md` considers the impact on relevant core components like `ai_whisperer/main.py` and `ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py`."
