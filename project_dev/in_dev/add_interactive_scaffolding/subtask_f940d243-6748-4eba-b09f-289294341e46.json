  "description": "Generate tests for setting up the Textual UI framework.",
  "instructions": [
    "Create a new Python file at `tests/unit/test_textual_setup.py`.",
    "Import necessary modules for mocking (e.g., `unittest.mock`).",
    "Define a test class, for example, `TestTextualSetup`.",
    "Inside the test class, define test methods for each verification point:",
    "- `test_basic_app_creation`: Mock the `textual.app.App` constructor to verify it's called with expected arguments.",
    "- `test_app_run_mock`: Mock the `textual.app.App.run` method and assert it's called. This simulates running without a real event loop.",
    "- `test_delegate_replacement_interactive_mode`: Mock the mechanism that replaces the default delegate when interactive mode is enabled. Assert that the default delegate is replaced by a mock interactive delegate.",
    "- `test_delegate_restoration_exit`: Mock the mechanism that restores the original delegate when the interactive session ends. Assert that the original delegate is restored.",
    "Use `unittest.mock` or similar library to create mock objects and patch methods.",
    "Ensure that the tests are written to assert the *calls* and *state changes* related to setup and delegate handling, not the actual UI behavior.",
    "Add basic assertions to each test method (e.g., `self.fail()`) to ensure they initially fail, indicating the feature is not yet implemented but the test structure is in place.",
    "Include necessary imports and basic test structure to make the file syntactically correct and runnable."

    "Running `pytest tests/unit/test_textual_setup.py` executes the tests.",
    "The tests in `tests/unit/test_textual_setup.py` currently fail due to the unimplemented feature logic."
