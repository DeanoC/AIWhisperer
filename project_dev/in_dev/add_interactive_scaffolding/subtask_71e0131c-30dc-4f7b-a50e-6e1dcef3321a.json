  "instructions": [
    "Create a new file `tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py`.",
    "Inside `tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py`, write integration tests using the `pytest` framework.",
    "The tests should simulate sending a Double Ctrl-C signal to the application.",
    "Implement a test function that verifies the application initiates the exit process upon receiving the simulated signal.",
    "Implement a test function that checks if the application terminates cleanly after the simulated signal.",
    "Implement a test function that verifies the original delegate is restored before the application terminates.",
    "Use mocking or other appropriate techniques to simulate the signal handling mechanism without relying on actual signal delivery, as direct signal handling testing can be unreliable across different environments.",
    "Ensure the tests are structured to compile and run without errors.",
    "The tests should be designed to *fail* when run against the current application code, as the graceful exit feature is not yet implemented. This confirms the tests correctly identify the missing functionality."

  "constraints": [
    "Tests must simulate signal handling; actual signal handling might be difficult to test directly in some environments.",
    "Tests should verify state changes (like delegate restoration) before exit.",
    "The tests must use the `pytest` framework.",
    "The tests should be located in the `tests/integration/` directory."

  "validation_criteria": [
    "The file `tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py` exists.",
    "The file `tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py` contains valid Python code.",
    "The file `tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py` includes test functions (e.g., `test_exit_signal_initiation`, `test_clean_termination`, `test_delegate_restoration`).",
    "Running `pytest tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py` from the project root executes the tests.",
    "The tests in `tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py` are designed to fail when run against the current codebase, indicating the feature is not yet implemented."
