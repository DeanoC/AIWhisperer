      "Identify the specific OpenRouter API endpoint(s) required to fetch detailed information about models, beyond just their IDs and basic names.",
      "Determine which fields (e.g., context window, pricing, capabilities) should be retrieved for each model based on the requirements.",
      "Plan how to modify `src/ai_whisperer/main.py` to correctly parse the `--output-csv` argument specifically when used with `--list-models`.",
      "Design a suitable Python data structure (e.g., list of dictionaries) to hold the comprehensive model details fetched from the API.",
      "Outline the logic for transforming the fetched data into a CSV format, including header rows and proper escaping of values.",
      "Detail the necessary code changes in both `src/ai_whisperer/main.py` (for argument parsing, data handling, and CSV output) and `src/ai_whisperer/openrouter_api.py` (for making the enhanced API calls and parsing the response).",
      "Document the entire plan in `docs/openrouter_model_enhancement_plan.md`. This document should clearly specify the OpenRouter API endpoints to be used, the exact data fields to be retrieved and stored, the strategy for integrating and handling the `--output-csv` argument, and the detailed plan for formatting and writing the data to the CSV file."
