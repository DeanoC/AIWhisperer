  "description": "Implement the basic structure and methods for the `code_generation` execution engine handler.",
  "instructions": [
    "Create a new Python file at `src/ai_whisperer/agent_handlers/code_generation.py`.",
    "Define a class or functions within `code_generation.py` that will serve as the handler for tasks with the type `code_generation`.",
    "Refer to `docs/code_generation_handler_design.md` for the specific class name, method signatures, and overall structure required.",
    "Implement the basic structure of the handler, including necessary imports from other modules within the project.",
    "Add the newly created handler class/function to the `__init__.py` file in the `src/ai_whisperer/agent_handlers/` directory to register it with the execution engine.",
    "Implement just enough placeholder logic within the handler methods to allow the unit tests defined in `tests/unit/test_code_generation_handler.py` to execute without immediate errors (they are not expected to pass at this stage).",
    "Review existing handler implementations in `src/ai_whisperer/agent_handlers/` (e.g., `ai_interaction.py`, `planning.py`, `validation.py`) to identify common patterns, base classes, or utility functions that can be leveraged or adapted for the `code_generation` handler."

    "The code in `code_generation.py` must be valid Python syntax.",
    "The project should compile without errors, and the unit tests in `tests/unit/test_code_generation_handler.py` should be runnable (even if they fail)."
