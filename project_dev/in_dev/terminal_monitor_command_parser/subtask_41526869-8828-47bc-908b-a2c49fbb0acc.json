  "description": "Implement the core terminal command parsing logic, command history, and integrate basic editing capabilities.",
  "instructions": [
    "Create the file `src/ai_whisperer/terminal_monitor/command_parser.py`.",
    "Within `command_parser.py`, implement a class or functions responsible for parsing user input from the terminal.",
    "The parser should be able to identify commands and their arguments based on the design documented in `docs/terminal_command_mode_design.md`.",
    "Implement a mechanism to store and retrieve previously entered commands, providing a command history feature.",
    "Explore using a library like `prompt_toolkit` to enhance the command line editing experience (e.g., arrow key navigation, basic text editing). If `prompt_toolkit` is not feasible or desired, implement basic editing features manually.",
    "Ensure the implemented parsing logic and features correctly handle various command formats and edge cases as specified in the design document.",
    "Run the unit tests located in `tests/unit/test_terminal_command_parser.py` and ensure all tests pass.",
    "Modify `src/ai_whisperer/terminal_monitor/__init__.py` to include necessary imports or initialization code for the new `command_parser` module."

  "constraints": [
    "The implementation must adhere to the design specifications in `docs/terminal_command_mode_design.md`.",
    "The code must be written in Python.",
    "Prioritize using standard Python libraries where possible, but consider `prompt_toolkit` for enhanced editing.",
    "The implementation should be modular and testable."

  "validation_criteria": [
    "The file `src/ai_whisperer/terminal_monitor/command_parser.py` exists and contains the core command parsing logic.",
    "The implemented command history functionality stores and retrieves commands correctly.",
    "Basic command line editing features (or `prompt_toolkit` integration) function as expected.",
    "All unit tests in `tests/unit/test_terminal_command_parser.py` execute without errors and pass successfully.",
    "`src/ai_whisperer/terminal_monitor/__init__.py` is updated to integrate the new module."
