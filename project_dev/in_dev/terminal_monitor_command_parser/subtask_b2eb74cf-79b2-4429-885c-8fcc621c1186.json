  "description": "Generate unit tests for the core command parsing logic, history, editing, and basic command recognition.",
  "instructions": [
    "Create a new Python file `tests/unit/test_terminal_command_parser.py`.",
    "Import necessary testing frameworks (e.g., `pytest`).",
    "Define a test class or functions to group tests for the terminal command parser.",
    "Based on the design document `docs/terminal_command_mode_design.md`, write unit tests covering:",
    "- Successful parsing of simple commands without arguments (e.g., `exit`).",
    "- Successful parsing of commands with one or more arguments (e.g., `debugger arg1 arg2`).",
    "- Handling of quotes and special characters within arguments.",
    "- Testing the command history functionality:",
    "  - Adding commands to history.",
    "  - Navigating history (e.g., simulating up/down arrow key presses if applicable, or testing history retrieval methods).",
    "  - Handling empty history.",
    "- Testing basic command line editing features (if implemented or integrated, e.g., backspace, cursor movement). If a third-party library is used, focus on testing the integration points.",
    "- Verifying that valid registered commands are recognized.",
    "- Testing how unregistered or invalid commands are handled (e.g., raising an error or returning a specific status).",
    "Include test stubs (empty test functions or functions with a `pytest.mark.skip` or `pass`) for the specific initial commands (`exit`, `debugger`, `ask`) that will be implemented in later steps. These stubs should indicate where tests for the command execution logic will eventually go.",
    "Ensure tests cover edge cases for command parsing (e.g., multiple spaces, leading/trailing spaces, empty input) and history (e.g., history size limits if applicable).",
    "Use clear and descriptive test names."

    "The tests compile and can be run using pytest.",
    "The tests for the core parsing/history logic should fail if the corresponding code is not yet implemented, but the test structure should be valid."
