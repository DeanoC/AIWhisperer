  "description": "Implement command coloring, help generation, shortcut handling, and alias support.",
  "instructions": [
    "Analyze the existing code in `src/ai_whisperer/terminal_monitor/command_parser.py` and `src/ai_whisperer/terminal_monitor/commands.py` to understand the current command handling structure.",
    "Review the design document `docs/terminal_command_mode_design.md` for any specific requirements or guidelines related to coloring, help, shortcuts, and aliases.",
    "Implement logic within `src/ai_whisperer/terminal_monitor/command_parser.py` or `src/ai_whisperer/terminal_monitor/commands.py` to color commands and arguments. Consider using the integrated terminal library's capabilities for this.",
    "Add a mechanism for commands to store and provide help text. This could involve adding a `help_text` attribute to command objects or a separate help registry.",
    "Create a handler for a 'help' command (or similar) that retrieves and displays the help text for other commands.",
    "Implement logic to handle shortcuts. Specifically, configure the terminal monitor to recognize 'q' as a shortcut for the 'exit' command.",
    "Develop functionality for defining and resolving command aliases. This might involve maintaining a dictionary or similar structure mapping aliases to their corresponding commands.",
    "Ensure the implemented features are integrated correctly into the command parsing and execution flow.",
    "Run the unit tests in `tests/unit/test_terminal_command_features.py` and fix any failures.",
    "Manually test the implemented features in the terminal monitor to verify they work as expected according to the validation criteria."

  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "When commands and arguments are entered in the terminal monitor, they are displayed with appropriate coloring.",
    "Executing the help command (or similar) displays a list of available commands and their help text.",
    "Typing 'q' at the command prompt results in the 'exit' command being executed.",
    "Users can define an alias for a command (e.g., `alias ls list-files`) and then use the alias (e.g., `ls`) to execute the original command (`list-files`).",
    "The implementation passes all tests in `tests/unit/test_terminal_command_features.py`."
