        "- Input Handling & Command Reliability: Thoroughly test user command input (e.g., `exit`, `debug`, `ask`). Commands should be accepted reliably without loss, especially under high logging load. Test responsiveness with rapid/continuous input.",
        "- Stability Under Stress: Simulate high volumes of log messages to check for freezes, crashes, display artifacts, or excessive CPU usage.",
        "- Dynamic Status Updates: Verify that changes to runner status, plan name, and active subtask ID are reflected accurately and immediately.",
        "- Graceful UI Shutdown: Confirm \"exit\" or \"quit\" commands lead to a clean shutdown of the monitor and `set_active_monitor_handler(None)` is called.",
        "- `monitor_enabled = False` Behavior: Ensure correct application operation without the monitor UI when disabled.",
        "- Correct Execution: Confirm AI execution (e.g., a simple plan) runs correctly in its own thread.",
        "- UI Updates: Verify logs and status updates from the AI Runner Thread are correctly passed to and displayed by the UI Thread (when monitoring is active).",
        "- Graceful Shutdown/Interruption: Test graceful shutdown/interruption of the AI Runner Thread.",
