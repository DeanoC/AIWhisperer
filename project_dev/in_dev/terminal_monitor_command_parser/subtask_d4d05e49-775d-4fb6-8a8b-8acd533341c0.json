  "description": "Generate tests for command coloring, help generation, shortcut handling, and alias support.",
  "instructions": [
    "Create a new Python file at `tests/unit/test_terminal_command_features.py`.",
    "Import necessary testing frameworks (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest.mock`).",
    "Define test functions within the new file.",
    "For command coloring, create test cases that verify the expected output structure or use mocking to simulate terminal output and check for ANSI escape codes or other coloring indicators.",
    "For help generation, create test cases that call the help function/method for various commands and assert that the output matches expected help text.",
    "For shortcut handling, create test cases that simulate user input of a shortcut ('q') and verify that the corresponding command ('exit') is triggered or processed correctly.",
    "For alias functionality, create test cases that define an alias (e.g., 'ls' for 'list'), simulate user input using the alias, and verify that the aliased command is executed.",
    "Ensure tests are structured logically and cover edge cases where applicable.",
    "Add necessary imports and setup/teardown methods if required by the testing framework.",
    "The tests should be designed to pass once the corresponding command mode features are fully implemented."

    "Tests must be placed in the `tests/unit/` directory.",
    "The test file must be named `test_terminal_command_features.py`.",
    "Tests should use the `pytest` framework.",
    "Tests should focus on the behavior of the command mode features, not their internal implementation details unless necessary for mocking.",
    "Avoid implementing the actual command mode logic in the test file; the tests should only define the expected behavior."

    "The file `tests/unit/test_terminal_command_features.py` exists.",

    "Running `pytest tests/unit/test_terminal_command_features.py` executes the tests.",
    "The tests currently fail, indicating they are testing features that are not yet fully implemented."
