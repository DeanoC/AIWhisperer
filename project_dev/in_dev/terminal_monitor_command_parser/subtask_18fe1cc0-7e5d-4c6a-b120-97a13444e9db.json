  "instructions": [
    "Open a terminal in the project root directory.",
    "Ensure your Python environment is activated.",
    "Run the unit tests specifically for terminal command features using pytest. The command should target the file: `pytest tests/unit/test_terminal_command_features.py`.",
    "Verify that all tests in the output pass without errors.",
    "After the tests pass, run the AI Whisperer application manually in the terminal using the command: `python src/ai_whisperer/main.py` (or the appropriate command to start the monitor).",
    "Within the running AI Whisperer terminal monitor, perform the following manual checks:",
    "- Type various valid commands (e.g., `help`, `config`, `exit`) and observe if they and their arguments are displayed with the expected color highlighting.",
    "- Type the `help` command and press Enter. Verify that the output displays accurate and up-to-date information about the available commands and their usage.",
    "- Type `q` and press Enter. Verify that this shortcut correctly initiates the exit process for the terminal monitor.",
    "- Attempt to define an alias using the appropriate command (refer to the help output if needed). For example, `alias qc exit`. Then, type the defined alias (`qc`) and press Enter. Verify that the alias executes the intended command (`exit`).",
    "- Attempt to define another alias and use it to confirm alias functionality is robust."
