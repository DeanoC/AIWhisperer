    "Read the user requirements for terminal monitor command mode from `docs/monitor_terminal_analysis.md`.",

    "Design a modular architecture for the terminal command mode. This design should clearly define components for:",
    "- Command registration (how new commands are added)",
    "- Command parsing (how user input is interpreted)",
    "- Command execution (how commands are run)",
    "- Help generation (how command help is displayed)",
    "Outline how features such as command history, line editing (like Emacs or Vi modes), text coloring, keyboard shortcuts, and command aliases will be integrated into the design.",
    "Specify the design for the initial built-in commands: `exit` (to quit the monitor), `debugger` (to interact with a debugger, if applicable), and `ask` (to send a query to the AI). Detail their expected behavior and any required parameters.",
    "Document the complete design, including the architecture, feature integration plans, and initial command specifications, in the file `docs/terminal_command_mode_design.md`."
