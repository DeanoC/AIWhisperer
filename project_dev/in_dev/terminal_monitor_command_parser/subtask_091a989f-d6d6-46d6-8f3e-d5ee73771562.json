  "instructions": [
    "Navigate to the `tests/unit` directory.",
    "Create a new Python file named `test_terminal_commands.py` if it doesn't exist.",
    "Import necessary modules for testing (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest.mock`).",
    "Create a test class, for example, `TestTerminalCommands`.",
    "Inside the test class, create test methods for each command:",
    "- `test_exit_command`: Test that 'exit', 'quit', and 'q' commands call a mocked exit function. Use `unittest.mock.patch` to replace the actual exit call.",
    "- `test_debugger_command`: Test that the 'debugger' command calls a mocked debugger attachment function. Use `unittest.mock.patch` to replace the actual debugger attachment logic.",
    "- `test_ask_command`: Test that the 'ask $prompt' command correctly parses the prompt and calls a mocked AI interaction service function with the extracted prompt. Use `unittest.mock.patch` to replace the AI interaction service call.",
    "Ensure the tests are structured to assert that the mocked functions are called with the expected arguments (or called at all in the case of exit/debugger).",
    "Do NOT implement the actual command logic in these tests; focus solely on verifying that the correct functions are *called* when the commands are parsed.",
    "The tests should initially fail when run against the current codebase because the command handling logic is not yet fully implemented."

    "Tests must use appropriate mocking techniques (`unittest.mock` is recommended) to isolate the command parsing and initial function calls.",

    "Running `pytest tests/unit/test_terminal_commands.py` executes the tests.",
    "The tests compile and run without syntax errors.",
