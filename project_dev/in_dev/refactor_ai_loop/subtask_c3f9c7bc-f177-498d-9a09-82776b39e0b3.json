    "Create a new Python file at the path `tests/unit/test_context_manager.py`.",
    "Import necessary modules for testing (e.g., `pytest`) and the `ContextManager` class (once implemented).",

    "Specifically, include tests for:",
    "- Initializing the `ContextManager`.",
    "- Adding messages to the context history.",
    "- Retrieving the full context history.",
    "- Handling different roles (e.g., 'system', 'user', 'assistant').",
    "- Any constraints or specific behaviors outlined in the design document.",
    "Ensure that the test functions are structured to clearly indicate what functionality they are testing.",
    "For now, the tests should be written assuming the `ContextManager` class exists with the expected methods and attributes, but the actual implementation is missing or incomplete.",
    "Run the tests using `pytest` to confirm that the test file is correctly structured, the tests are discovered, and they compile and run without syntax errors.",
    "Verify that the tests fail as expected because the `ContextManager` class or its methods are not yet fully implemented."
