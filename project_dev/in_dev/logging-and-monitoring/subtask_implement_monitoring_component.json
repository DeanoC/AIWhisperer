      "Create a new Python module `src/ai_whisperer/monitoring.py`.",
      "Implement functions and classes within `monitoring.py` to track the execution status of the overall plan and individual steps.",
      "Leverage the state management logic from `src/ai_whisperer/state_management.py` to access and update the current execution state.",
      "Design and implement a simple terminal-based user interface within `monitoring.py` to display the current execution status.",
      "The terminal UI should show the overall plan status (e.g., 'Running', 'Paused', 'Completed', 'Failed') and the status of the currently executing step.",
      "Implement hooks or mechanisms within the monitoring component to allow for integration with future pause, cancel, and user input functionalities (though the full implementation of these interactions is not required in this subtask).",
      "Ensure the implemented code adheres to the design principles outlined in `project_dev/in_dev/logging-and-monitoring/logging_monitoring_design.md`.",
      "Develop the code to pass all tests defined in `tests/unit/test_monitoring.py`."

    "validation_criteria": [
      "The file `src/ai_whisperer/monitoring.py` is created.",
      "The code in `src/ai_whisperer/monitoring.py` contains logic for tracking execution status.",
      "The code in `src/ai_whisperer/monitoring.py` includes a basic terminal view for displaying status.",
      "The code successfully passes all tests defined in `tests/unit/test_monitoring.py`."
