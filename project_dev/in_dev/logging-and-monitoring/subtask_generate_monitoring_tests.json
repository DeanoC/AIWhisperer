      "Create a new file `tests/unit/test_monitoring.py`.",
      "Write unit tests for the execution status tracking and terminal monitoring view components of the AIWhisperer runner.",
      "Refer to the design document `project_dev/in_dev/logging-and-monitoring/logging_monitoring_design.md` for implementation details of the status tracking and monitoring view.",
      "Ensure the tests cover the following scenarios:",
      "- Verifying that the execution status can be updated correctly (e.g., from 'pending' to 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled').",
      "- Testing the retrieval of the current execution status.",
      "- Simulating a simplified plan execution flow and asserting that the status transitions through the expected states.",
      "- Testing the rendering logic of the terminal monitoring view. This may require mocking terminal output or using libraries that simulate terminal environments.",
      "- Testing how the monitoring view handles different execution states and displays relevant information.",
      "- Testing the interaction points for user actions like pause, cancel, and adding context. This will likely involve mocking input events or signals that trigger these actions and verifying the system's response.",
      "- Include tests for edge cases, such as updating status with invalid values or handling unexpected states.",
      "Structure the tests logically, using appropriate test classes and methods.",
      "Use standard Python testing libraries like `pytest`."

    "constraints": [
      "Do not modify any files outside of the `tests/unit/` directory, except for potentially adding necessary test data or mock objects if required, but prioritize mocking.",
      "Focus strictly on generating tests for the status tracking and terminal monitoring view components."

    "validation_criteria": [
      "The file `tests/unit/test_monitoring.py` must be created.",
      "The file `test_monitoring.py` must contain test functions or methods.",
      "The tests in `test_monitoring.py` must specifically target the execution status tracking and terminal monitoring view components.",
      "Tests for updating and retrieving execution status must be present.",
      "Tests simulating plan execution status changes must be present.",
      "Tests for the rendering of the terminal monitoring view must be present.",
      "Tests covering interaction points for pause/cancel/add context must be present.",
      "The tests should include cases for various execution states (e.g., pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled).",
      "The generated code should adhere to standard Python testing practices and conventions."
