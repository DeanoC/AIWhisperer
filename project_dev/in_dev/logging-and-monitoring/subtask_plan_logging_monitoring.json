      "Design the logging system, defining the structure and content of log messages for various runner actions, including but not limited to: plan step execution (start, success, failure), AI service calls (request, response, error), file operations (read, write, create, delete), and terminal command execution (command, output, exit code). Consider different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).",
      "Outline the mechanism for tracking and exposing the execution status of the overall plan and individual steps. This should include states like 'pending', 'running', 'paused', 'cancelled', 'completed', 'failed'.",
      "Propose a design for a terminal-based monitoring view that can display the current execution status and recent log messages in a user-friendly format.",
      "Detail how user interactions like pausing, cancelling, and adding context during execution will be reflected in the logging and state management systems. Consider how these actions might trigger specific log messages or state transitions.",
