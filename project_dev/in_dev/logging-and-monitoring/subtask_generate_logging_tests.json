      "- Test the logging of actions, including the correct capture and association of metadata such as `step_id`, agent type, and any other relevant context defined in the design.",
      "- Include tests to confirm that logs are correctly written to the configured output destinations (e.g., console, file).",
      "- If the design document specifies requirements for concurrent logging, implement tests to verify the logging system's behavior under concurrent conditions.",
      "- Use standard Python testing frameworks (like `pytest`) and mocking where necessary to isolate the logging component.",
