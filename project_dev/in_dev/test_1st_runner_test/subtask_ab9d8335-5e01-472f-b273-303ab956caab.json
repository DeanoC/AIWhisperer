    "Navigate to the root directory of the AIWhisperer project.",
    "Ensure your Python environment is activated and all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed.",
    "Run the integration tests specifically targeting the '1st_runner_test' plan execution.",
    "Use a command like `pytest tests/integration/test_ai_tool_usage.py` or a more specific command if only a subset of tests in that file are relevant to the '1st_runner_test' plan.",
    "Monitor the test execution output to confirm that all relevant tests pass without errors.",
    "Specifically look for output messages or assertions within the tests that confirm the successful execution and expected behavior of the '1st_runner_test' plan by the AIWhisperer runner."
