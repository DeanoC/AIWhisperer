    "Review the provided design document `project_dev/notes/Thread-Safe Delegates Design Document.md` and usage guide `project_dev/notes/Thread-Safe Delegates in Python - Usage Guide.md` to fully understand the thread-safe delegate system's architecture and intended use.",
    "Analyze the `project_dev/planning/delegate_integration_plan.md` to identify the specific locations within the AI loop (`src/ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py`) where delegate hooks should be added.",
    "Using the example code in `project_dev/notes/thread_safe_delegates.py` as a reference, integrate the thread-safe delegate system into `src/ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py`.",
    "Implement the delegate hooks at the identified key points in the AI loop, ensuring they correctly call the delegate system methods.",
    "Verify that the implementation adheres to the thread-safe principles outlined in the design documents and example code.",
    "Run the unit tests located in `tests/ai_loop/test_delegates.py` to confirm the correct functionality and thread-safety of the implemented delegate system within the AI loop.",
    "Address any test failures, debugging the implementation in `src/ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py` until all tests in `tests/ai_loop/test_delegates.py` pass."
