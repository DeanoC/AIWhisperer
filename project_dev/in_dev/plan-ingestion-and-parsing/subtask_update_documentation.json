      "Update the `docs/internal_process.md` file to add a new section detailing the runner's internal process for ingesting, parsing, and validating AI-generated JSON plans. Describe the flow from reading the file to validating its structure and content.",
      "In both updated documentation files, clearly explain the expected JSON plan file format. Refer users to the relevant JSON schema files (`src/ai_whisperer/schemas/task_schema.json` and `src/ai_whisperer/schemas/subtask_schema.json`) and explain their purpose.",
