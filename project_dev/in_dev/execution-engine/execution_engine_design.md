# Execution Engine Design

## Introduction

The Execution Engine is responsible for sequentially or concurrently executing tasks defined in the plan. It manages the state of execution for each task (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed, failed) and supports conditional logic or branching if specified in the plan (advanced feature).

## Design Considerations

1. **Sequential Execution**: The Execution Engine will execute tasks sequentially by default. Concurrent execution will be considered as an advanced feature.
2. **State Management**: The Execution Engine will interact with the State Management feature to store and retrieve intermediate results and execution state.
3. **Error Handling**: The Execution Engine will handle errors gracefully, updating the state of failed tasks and providing error messages.
4. **Conditional Logic**: The Execution Engine will support conditional logic in the plan, allowing for branching based on the results of previous tasks.

## Architecture

The Execution Engine will consist of the following components:

1. **Task Queue**: A queue of tasks to be executed, ordered based on the plan.
2. **Task Executor**: A component responsible for executing individual tasks.
3. **State Manager**: A component that interacts with the State Management feature to store and retrieve task states and intermediate results.
4. **Error Handler**: A component that handles errors during task execution and updates the state accordingly.

## Data Structures

The Execution Engine will use the following data structures:

1. **Task**: A data structure representing a task, including its ID, type, parameters, and dependencies.
2. **Task State**: A data structure representing the state of a task, including its status (pending, in-progress, completed, failed) and intermediate results.

## Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: The Execution Engine loads the plan and initializes the task queue.
2. **Task Execution**: The Execution Engine dequeues tasks from the task queue and executes them sequentially.
3. **State Update**: After each task execution, the Execution Engine updates the state of the task and stores intermediate results.
4. **Error Handling**: If a task fails, the Execution Engine updates its state and handles the error appropriately.
5. **Completion**: The Execution Engine continues executing tasks until all tasks are completed or an unrecoverable error occurs.

## Interfaces

The Execution Engine will provide the following interfaces:

1. `execute_plan(plan)`: Executes the given plan.
2. `get_task_status(task_id)`: Returns the status of a task.
3. `get_task_result(task_id)`: Returns the intermediate result of a task.

## Dependencies

The Execution Engine depends on the following components:

1. **State Management**: For storing and retrieving task states and intermediate results.
2. **Plan Ingestion and Parsing**: For ingesting and parsing the plan into an internal representation.

## Testing Strategy

The Execution Engine will be tested using unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests will focus on individual components, while integration tests will verify the interactions between components and the overall execution flow.
