      "Describe the process of using the module to send prompts to AI services via OpenRouter.",
      "Provide clear instructions and code examples for handling both standard (single response) and streaming (chunked response) interactions.",

      "A new file `docs/ai_service_interaction.md` exists.",
      "`docs/ai_service_interaction.md` provides a comprehensive overview of the module, including purpose, configuration integration, and usage (standard and streaming).",
      "`docs/usage.md` has been modified and includes examples demonstrating the use of the AI Service Interaction Module.",
      "The documentation accurately reflects the implemented features and integration points of the AI Service Interaction Module as found in the source code.",
      "Documentation follows the general structure and style of other files in the `docs/` directory."
