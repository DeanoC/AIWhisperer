      "Create a new markdown file at the path `test/simple_project/javascript_3d_globe_requirements.md`.",
      "The content of this markdown file should detail the requirements for adding a new feature to the existing JavaScript hello world project, as described in `test/simple_project/javascript_hello_world_requirements.md`.",
      "Clearly state within the document that the implementation of this feature must be done on a dedicated new branch, separate from the main project branch.",
      "Describe the core feature: creating a modern web application that visualizes a 3D spinning globe.",
      "Specify that the implementation should leverage an appropriate JavaScript library for 3D rendering. Suggest examples like Three.js or Cesium, but allow for other suitable alternatives.",
      "Emphasize the requirement for a strict Test-first Development (TDD) approach for implementing this feature. Include examples of tests that should be written before the corresponding code, such as tests for verifying the successful loading of the chosen 3D library, checking for the dynamic creation of a canvas element for rendering, and confirming the proper setup of an animation loop for the globe's rotation.",
      "Define specific requirements related to displaying the 3D spinning globe, including aspects like initial orientation, rotation speed, and basic visual appearance (e.g., showing continents or a basic texture).",
      "Ensure the requirements are clear, concise, and actionable for a developer implementing the feature."

      "The output must ONLY be the markdown document content.",
      "Do NOT generate any source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the 3D globe feature.",
      "The generated requirements document must explicitly reference the base JavaScript project requirement document (`test/simple_project/javascript_hello_world_requirements.md`) as the foundation for this feature.",
      "The requirements must clearly state the need to display a 3D spinning globe."

      "The file content specifies that the feature should be implemented on a new branch.",
      "The file content references the base JavaScript project requirements document.",
