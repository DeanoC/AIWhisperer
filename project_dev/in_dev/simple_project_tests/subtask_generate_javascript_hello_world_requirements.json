      "The markdown file should serve as the requirements document for a simple web JavaScript 'Hello, World!' project.",

      "Specify that the project should be built from scratch.",
      "Include the requirement to initialize a git repository for the project.",
      "List standard GitHub repository files that should be included, such as a README.md, .gitignore, and potentially a LICENSE file.",
      "Emphasize and clearly state that the project development must strictly follow a Test-first Development (TDD) methodology.",
      "Suggest using a JavaScript testing framework like Jest if there is significant JavaScript logic that can be unit tested.",
      "Alternatively, if the logic is minimal, define specific validation steps or acceptance criteria that can be used to verify the HTML/JavaScript interaction and the 'Hello, World!' output.",
