      "Clearly state that the implementation of this new 'echo' feature must be done on a separate Git branch.",
      "Detail the desired behavior of the 'echo' feature: the program should prompt the user for input, read the input provided by the user, and then display (echo) that input back to the user.",
      "Explicitly state that the development of this feature must adhere strictly to the Test-first Development (TDD) methodology. This means tests for the feature's behavior must be written *before* the code that implements the behavior.",
