  "description": "Design a strategy to restrict the runner's file system access to only the workspace and output directories.",
  "instructions": [
    "Review the analysis of the path manager usage in `docs/path_manager_analysis.md` to understand how paths are currently handled and identify potential vulnerabilities.",
    "Based on the analysis, design a mechanism to enforce strict file system access control for the runner process.",
    "The mechanism must ensure the runner can *only* read from the directory designated as the workspace.",
    "The mechanism must ensure the runner can *only* read from and write to the directory designated as the output directory.",
    "The mechanism must prevent the runner from accessing any files or directories outside of the designated workspace and output directories.",
    "Consider various techniques for achieving this restriction, such as:",
    "- Using operating system-level sandboxing or containerization (e.g., `chroot`, Docker, namespaces).",
    "- Implementing language-specific mechanisms or libraries that provide controlled file access.",
    "- Utilizing virtual file systems or abstracting file operations within the application.",
    "Document the chosen strategy in `docs/directory_restriction_strategy.md`.",
    "Clearly outline how the runner will be configured or informed about the specific paths designated as the workspace and output directories.",
    "Specify how the existing path shortcuts, such as '{workspace}' and '{output}', will be interpreted and handled within the runner's environment under the new restriction strategy, especially in scenarios where the workspace and output directories are distinct."

  "constraints": [
    "The strategy must be robust and secure, effectively preventing the runner from escaping the defined workspace and output directories.",
    "The strategy should aim for a balance between security and ease of implementation/maintenance.",

    "The strategy in `docs/directory_restriction_strategy.md` discusses potential methods for preventing directory traversal or 'escape' attempts."
