  "instructions": [
    "Open the README.md file in the project root directory.",
    "Locate the section related to running tasks or commands.",
    "Add a new subsection titled 'File System Access and Path Handling' or similar.",
    "In this new subsection, clearly explain that the runner is restricted to accessing files and directories only within the defined workspace and output directories.",
    "Explain that attempting to access paths outside of these designated areas will result in an error.",
    "Describe how the workspace and output directories are determined (e.g., configuration, command line arguments).",
    "Explicitly document the use of the '{workspace}' and '{output}' path shortcuts, explaining that these are replaced with the actual paths to the workspace and output directories respectively.",
    "Provide examples of how these shortcuts should be used in task definitions or command arguments.",
    "Discuss the implications of these restrictions for users, such as needing to place necessary input files within the workspace or ensuring output is directed to the output directory.",
    "Open the `docs/developer_guide.md` file.",
    "Find or create a relevant section for developers, possibly under 'Execution Engine' or 'Task Runner'.",
    "Add similar details about the file system access restrictions and path handling, focusing on the technical implementation and considerations for developers creating new task types or tools.",
    "Explain how the path management logic handles different path formats and the resolution of '{workspace}' and '{output}'.",
    "Mention any relevant configuration settings or internal mechanisms related to path handling and security.",
    "Review both `README.md` and `docs/developer_guide.md` to ensure the information is consistent, clear, and accurately reflects the implemented restrictions and path handling."
