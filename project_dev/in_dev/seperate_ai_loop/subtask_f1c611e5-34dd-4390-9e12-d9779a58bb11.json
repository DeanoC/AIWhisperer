  "description": "Design the structure and interface for the refactored standalone AI loop component, considering the requirements for interactivity, streaming, and generality.",
  "instructions": [
    "Review the analysis document `docs/ai_loop_refactor_analysis.md` to understand the current AI loop's limitations and requirements.",
    "Propose a new class or module structure for the refactored AI loop. Consider creating a dedicated module (e.g., `ai_whisperer/ai_loop_refactored.py`) to house this component.",
    "Define clear Python class interfaces and method signatures for the new AI loop. Focus on minimizing direct dependencies on `ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py` and `ai_whisperer/state_management.py`. Consider using dependency injection or abstract interfaces.",
    "Outline how the design will support interactive sessions, allowing for multi-turn conversations and user input during the AI process.",
    "Describe the mechanism for handling streaming AI responses, enabling incremental output to the user or other components.",
    "Detail how the AI loop can be made general purpose, potentially by defining abstract base classes or interfaces for tasks, agents, or tools that can be plugged into the loop.",
    "Document the proposed design, including class diagrams (if helpful), interface definitions, and explanations of how interactivity, streaming, and generality are achieved, in the file `docs/refactored_ai_loop_design.md`."
