  "instructions": [
    "Open and carefully read the code in `ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py`.",
    "Review the code in `ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py` and `ai_whisperer/state_management.py` to understand their functionalities and interfaces.",
    "In `ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py`, systematically identify every line or block of code that directly calls methods from or accesses attributes of instances of `ExecutionEngine` or `StateManager`.",
    "For each identified interaction point, document the specific method or attribute being used and the context in `ai_loop.py`.",
    "Create a new Markdown file at `docs/ai_loop_refactor_analysis.md`.",
    "In `docs/ai_loop_refactor_analysis.md`, list all the identified dependencies clearly, perhaps using code snippets or line numbers for reference.",
    "Based on the identified dependencies, propose initial ideas for how these interactions could be refactored to reduce direct coupling (e.g., using dependency injection, introducing intermediate services, or event-driven patterns).",
    "Ensure the proposed ideas are high-level and focus on the concept of decoupling, not the detailed implementation."
