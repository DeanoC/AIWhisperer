  "description": "Generate integration tests to verify the refactored AI loop's interaction with other components, especially in interactive and streaming scenarios.",
  "instructions": [
    "Create a new Python file `tests/integration/test_refactored_ai_loop_integration.py`.",
    "Import necessary components from `ai_whisperer.refactored_ai_loop`, `ai_whisperer.cli_commands`, and `monitor.interactive_list_models_ui`.",
    "Write test functions that simulate interactive user input and AI loop responses.",
    "Use mock objects or dependency injection as needed to isolate the AI loop and control its dependencies (e.g., simulating AI service responses).",
    "Implement test cases to specifically verify the handling of streaming responses within an interactive context.",
    "Create test cases that simulate the execution of the `list-models` command through the interactive AI loop interface.",
    "Verify that the refactored AI loop can process commands and produce output without relying on the `ExecutionEngine` or `StateManager`.",
    "Include assertions in the tests to check the expected behavior, such as the format and content of streaming output, the result of the `list-models` command, and the overall flow of an interactive session.",
    "Ensure the tests are designed to fail initially because the integration logic is not yet fully implemented or validated.",
    "Add necessary imports and setup/teardown methods if using a test framework like `pytest`."

    "Tests must focus on the integration points of the refactored AI loop.",
    "Tests should simulate interactive scenarios, including user input and streamed AI output.",
    "Tests must explicitly verify the interaction with the `list-models` command.",
    "Tests must confirm the absence of dependencies on `ExecutionEngine` and `StateManager` within the refactored loop's tested interactions.",
    "Tests should be written using a standard Python testing framework (e.g., pytest).",
    "The test file must be located at `tests/integration/test_refactored_ai_loop_integration.py`."

  "validation_criteria": [
    "A file named `tests/integration/test_refactored_ai_loop_integration.py` exists.",
    "The test file contains multiple test functions covering different interactive and streaming scenarios.",
    "There are specific test cases that simulate and verify the interaction with the `list-models` command.",
    "The test code includes assertions that check for correct handling of streaming output.",
    "The tests demonstrate that the refactored AI loop interacts with other components without direct reliance on `ExecutionEngine` or `StateManager`.",
    "Running the tests results in failures, indicating that the tests are in place but the corresponding implementation/validation is pending."
