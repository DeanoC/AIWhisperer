  "instructions": [
    "Locate the `run` command definition within `src/ai_whisperer/cli.py` or `src/ai_whisperer/commands.py`.",
    "Add a new boolean flag option to the `run` command. The option name should be based on the analysis in `docs/cli_analysis_monitor_option.md`. A likely candidate is `--monitor` or `--no-monitor`.",
    "Ensure the new option is defined as a boolean flag using the appropriate Click library decorators.",
    "Modify the function signature of the handler for the `run` command to accept the value of the new monitor option.",
    "Trace the command handling logic within `src/ai_whisperer/commands.py` (or relevant files) to identify where the option value needs to be passed to the execution engine or relevant components.",
    "Modify the calls to the execution engine or related functions to include the value of the new monitor option.",
    "Review `tests/unit/test_cli.py` to understand how CLI options are parsed and passed to the command handlers. Ensure your changes align with this pattern and the tests for the new option.",
    "Add necessary imports if required for the new option."

    "The value of the monitor option is correctly passed to the downstream execution logic.",
