  "instructions": [
    "Open the file `tests/integration/test_runner_logging_monitoring.py`.",
    "Based on the plan outlined in `docs/monitor_integration_plan.md`, identify the specific test cases required to verify the conditional starting of the monitor thread.",
    "Add new test methods within the appropriate test class in `test_runner_logging_monitoring.py`.",
    "Create one test case that simulates running the plan execution without the `--monitor` CLI option.",
    "Create another test case that simulates running the plan execution with the `--monitor` CLI option.",
    "Within the test case simulating the absence of the `--monitor` option, use `unittest.mock.patch` or `pytest.mock.patch` to mock `threading.Thread.start`.",
    "Assert that the mocked `threading.Thread.start` was NOT called in the test case without the `--monitor` option.",
    "Within the test case simulating the presence of the `--monitor` option, use `unittest.mock.patch` or `pytest.mock.patch` to mock `threading.Thread.start`.",
    "Assert that the mocked `threading.Thread.start` WAS called in the test case with the `--monitor` option.",
    "Ensure the test cases are structured correctly according to pytest conventions.",
    "Run the tests using `pytest tests/integration/test_runner_logging_monitoring.py` to verify that the new tests are discovered and the test structure is valid. It is expected that these new tests will initially fail as the implementation for conditional starting is not yet complete."
