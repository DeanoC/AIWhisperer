  "instructions": [
    "Open the file `tests/unit/test_cli.py`.",
    "Read the analysis document `docs/cli_analysis_monitor_option.md` to understand the expected behavior and parsing of the new `--monitor` CLI option.",
    "Identify the existing test class or function in `tests/unit/test_cli.py` that handles CLI argument parsing tests (likely involving `argparse`).",
    "Add new test methods within the appropriate test class or function to specifically test the `--monitor` option.",
    "Create one test case where the `--monitor` option is present in the command line arguments.",
    "In this test case, verify that the argument parser correctly recognizes `--monitor` and that the corresponding value (which should be `True` for a boolean flag) is stored in the parsed arguments object.",
    "Create another test case where the `--monitor` option is *absent* from the command line arguments.",
    "In this test case, verify that the argument parser correctly handles the absence of `--monitor` and that the corresponding value in the parsed arguments object defaults to `False`.",
    "Ensure the new test methods follow the existing testing style and conventions in `tests/unit/test_cli.py`.",
    "Save the modified `tests/unit/test_cli.py` file.",
    "Run the unit tests using `pytest tests/unit/test_cli.py` to confirm that the new tests are discovered and executed by the test runner. The new tests are expected to fail at this stage as the functionality is not yet implemented."
