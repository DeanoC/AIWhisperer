  "description": "Modify the execution engine to conditionally start the monitor thread based on the received option value.",
  "instructions": [
    "Analyze `docs/monitor_integration_plan.md` to determine whether `src/ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py` or `src/ai_whisperer/plan_runner.py` is the appropriate location to handle the monitor option and conditional thread start.",
    "Open the identified file (`src/ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py` or `src/ai_whisperer/plan_runner.py`).",
    "Locate the function or method responsible for initializing or starting the execution process.",
    "Modify the function/method signature or initial setup to accept the monitor option value, which should be received from the CLI handling logic (implemented in a previous step).",
    "Add a conditional statement (e.g., an `if` statement) that checks the value of the monitor option.",
    "Move the code that starts the monitor thread (likely found or related to `src/ai_whisperer/monitoring.py`) inside this conditional block.",
    "Ensure that the monitor thread is started only when the monitor option is enabled (e.g., its value is `True`).",
    "Review `tests/integration/test_runner_logging_monitoring.py` to understand how the conditional start of the monitor is tested and ensure your implementation aligns with these test cases.",
    "Make sure the monitor thread is created as a daemon thread to prevent it from blocking the main program exit.",
    "Verify that the changes do not negatively impact the existing execution flow when the monitor option is disabled."
