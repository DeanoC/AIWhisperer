  "description": "Analyze the execution engine and monitor code to determine how to conditionally start the monitor thread based on the new CLI option.",
  "instructions": [
    "Open and carefully examine the contents of `src/ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py`, `src/ai_whisperer/monitoring.py`, and `src/ai_whisperer/plan_runner.py`.",
    "Locate the specific code sections within these files that are responsible for initiating and managing the execution of a plan.",
    "Identify how the current code interacts with the monitoring functionality, specifically where the monitor thread is created or started.",
    "Based on the analysis from the previous step (`analyze_cli_structure`) and the information in `docs/cli_analysis_monitor_option.md`, determine the mechanism by which the value of the new CLI monitor option will be passed from the command-line parsing logic to the part of the code that controls the monitor thread.",
    "Pinpoint the exact location in the codebase where the monitor thread is currently started unconditionally.",
    "Develop a plan for modifying this location to make the monitor thread start conditional based on the value of the CLI option.",
    "Document the findings of this analysis, including the identified code locations, the proposed method for passing the CLI option value, and the detailed logic for conditionally starting the monitor thread, in the file `docs/monitor_integration_plan.md`. Ensure the document clearly outlines the steps required for the subsequent implementation subtasks."

    "The `docs/monitor_integration_plan.md` document must provide a detailed outline of the logic (e.g., if-condition based on option value) that will govern the conditional starting of the monitor thread."
