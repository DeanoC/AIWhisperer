    "Open and examine the files `src/ai_whisperer/cli.py`, `src/ai_whisperer/commands.py`, and `src/ai_whisperer/main.py`.",
    "Locate the command definition responsible for initiating the plan execution process. This is likely within `src/ai_whisperer/cli.py` or `src/ai_whisperer/commands.py`.",
    "Analyze the existing argument parsing structure (likely using `click` or similar library) to identify the most appropriate place to add a new boolean option.",
    "Consider potential names for the option, such as `--monitor`, `--show-monitor`, or `--enable-terminal-monitor`, and choose one that is clear and consistent with existing options.",
    "Determine how this new boolean option's value will be accessed and propagated through the application layers, specifically how it will reach the execution engine (`src/ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py`) or the AI loop (`src/ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py`) where the monitoring logic will likely reside.",
    "Document your analysis, including the identified command, the proposed option name and its location in the CLI definition, and the planned method for passing the option's value to the relevant execution components.",
    "Write these findings and the proposed integration point into the file `docs/cli_analysis_monitor_option.md`."
