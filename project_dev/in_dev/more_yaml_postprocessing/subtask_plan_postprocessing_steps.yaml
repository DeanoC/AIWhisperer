  instructions: 'Based on the project requirement to offload YAML formatting and cleanup
    to a postprocessing pipeline, identify the specific cleanup tasks needed. These
    tasks include:

    1. Indentation normalization.

    2. Ensuring required fields are present and setting defaults if necessary.

    3. Removing invalid or unrecognized fields.

    4. Performing basic YAML syntax validation.


    For each identified cleanup task, define a single, focused scripted step that
    will be added to the postprocessing pipeline.


    For each defined scripted step, outline its purpose and high-level logic. Consider
    potential tools or libraries that might be used (e.g., PyYAML, a custom parsing
    script).


    Document the entire plan, including the identified tasks, the defined steps, and
    the purpose/logic for each step, in the `docs/postprocessing_plan.md` file.

    '
  validation_criteria:
  - docs/postprocessing_plan.md exists.
  - docs/postprocessing_plan.md lists distinct steps for each cleanup task identified
    (indentation, field presence/defaults, removing invalid fields, syntax validation).
  - docs/postprocessing_plan.md describes the purpose and high-level logic for each
    listed step.
