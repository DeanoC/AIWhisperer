  instructions: "Update the documentation in the `docs` folder to reflect the new\
    \ postprocessing pipeline and its impact on prompt design.\n\n1.  **Document Postprocessing\
    \ Pipeline:**\n    *   Create or update `docs/postprocessing.md` to describe the\
    \ postprocessing pipeline.\n    *   Explain the purpose of the pipeline: offloading\
    \ YAML formatting and cleanup from AI agents.\n    *   Detail the individual steps\
    \ within the pipeline (e.g., YAML parsing, validation, cleanup, formatting).\n\
    \    *   Clearly explain how the pipeline ensures the quality and consistency\
    \ of the generated YAML output.\n    *   Mention the benefits of using the pipeline\
    \ (e.g., reduced agent complexity, improved output reliability).\n\n2.  **Update\
    \ Prompt Documentation:**\n    *   Update `docs/prompts.md` (and potentially other\
    \ relevant prompt guide sections) to reflect the simplified prompt requirements.\n\
    \    *   Explain that agents no longer need to focus heavily on precise YAML formatting\
    \ or cleanup.\n    *   Provide examples demonstrating how prompts can be simplified\
    \ by relying on the postprocessing pipeline for formatting and validation. Reference\
    \ the updated `prompts/orchestrator_default.md` and `prompts/subtask_generator_default.md`\
    \ as examples of simplified prompts.\n\n3.  **Integrate into Relevant Sections:**\n\
    \    *   Review and update relevant sections of the developer guide (`docs/developer_guide.md`)\
    \ and prompt guide (`docs/prompt_guide.md`) to refer to the new postprocessing\
    \ documentation and the updated prompt guidelines. Ensure consistency across documentation\
    \ files.\n"
  validation_criteria:
  - A new file `docs/postprocessing.md` has been created or an existing one updated.
  - The documentation in `docs/postprocessing.md` clearly explains the purpose and
    steps of the postprocessing pipeline.
  - The documentation explains how the postprocessing pipeline ensures YAML quality.
  - The documentation in `docs/prompts.md` (and related prompt guides) has been updated
    to reflect simplified prompt requirements.
  - Examples are provided in the documentation showing how prompts can be simplified.
  - Relevant sections of the developer and prompt guides have been updated to reference
    the new information.
