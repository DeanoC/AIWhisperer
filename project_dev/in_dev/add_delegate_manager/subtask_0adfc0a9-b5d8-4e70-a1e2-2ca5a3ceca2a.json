  "description": "Create tests to verify the correct integration and usage of DelegateManager in the target modules and CLI commands.",
  "instructions": [
    "Create a new test file `tests/test_delegate_manager_integration.py`.",
    "Import necessary modules, including `pytest`, `unittest.mock`, and the target modules: `plan_runner`, `initial_plan_generator`, `project_plan_generator` (formerly overview_plan_generator), and the relevant parts of `cli` (likely `list_models`).",
    "Define a test class for DelegateManager integration.",
    "Within the test class, create test methods for each target module/command (`plan_runner`, `initial_plan_generator`, `project_plan_generator`, `list_models`).",
    "For each test method, use `unittest.mock.patch` or similar mocking techniques to replace the actual `DelegateManager` with a mock object.",
    "Instantiate the target module/command, ensuring the mock `DelegateManager` is passed correctly during initialization or function calls.",
    "Simulate scenarios where the target module/command would interact with the `DelegateManager`, such as sending user-facing messages or attempting to pause/end execution.",
    "Assert that the mock `DelegateManager`'s methods (e.g., `send_message`, `check_pause_requested`, `check_end_requested`) were called with the expected arguments.",
    "Verify that the return values or behavior of the target module/command are correct based on the mocked `DelegateManager`'s responses (e.g., if `check_pause_requested` returns True).",
    "Ensure tests cover the initialization of `DelegateManager` and its usage for message routing and pause/end functionality in each target.",
    "Write clear and concise test names and docstrings explaining the purpose of each test."

    "Tests cover the usage of `DelegateManager` for handling pause/end requests.",
    "The test file is syntactically correct Python code.",
