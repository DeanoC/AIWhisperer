# AILoop Stabilization Checklist

This document outlines a step-by-step plan to stabilize and complete the `AILoop` module. Update this checklist as you progress.

---

## 1. Test Review & Categorization

- [x] **Run all AILoop-related tests**
  - [x] `test_ai_loop.py`
  - [x] `test_ai_loop_delegates.py`
  - [x] `test_refactored_ai_loop.py`
- [x] **List all test failures and errors**
  - [x] Categorize by:
    - [x] Async/task issues
    - [x] Delegate/callback issues
    - [x] Tool execution issues
    - [x] State/session management issues
- [x] **Mark or skip tests that depend on not-yet-implemented features**
  - [x] Document skipped tests and missing features

---

## 2. Core Lifecycle Methods

- [x] **Stabilize session lifecycle methods**
  - [x] `start_session`
  - [x] `stop_session`
  - [x] `pause`
  - [x] `resume`
- [x] **Ensure correct async behavior**
  - [x] All lifecycle methods are `async` and safe to call from event loop
  - [x] Properly handle double-start, stop-without-start, etc.
- [x] **Emit correct delegate notifications for each lifecycle event**
  - [x] Add/expand tests for all lifecycle transitions and edge cases

---

## 3. User Message Handling

- [x] **Ensure `send_user_message` works**
  - [x] Accepts input and triggers AI response
  - [x] Emits streaming notifications (chunked responses)
  - [x] Handles multi-turn conversations
  - [x] Add/expand tests for user message flow

---

## 4. Tool Call and Result Handling

- [x] **Test tool invocation from AILoop**
  - [x] Correctly delegates tool calls
  - [x] Handles tool results and routes them back to AI
  - [x] Emits notifications for tool calls and results
  - [x] Handles tool errors gracefully
  - [x] Add/expand tests for tool call/result flow and error cases

---

## 5. Async Task Management

- [x] **Audit all async/background task usage**
  - [x] Ensure all tasks are awaited or managed
  - [x] Clean up tasks on session stop (no warnings/leaks)
  - [x] Add tests for cancellation and shutdown scenarios

---

## 6. Delegate System Integration

- [x] **Verify all delegate notifications**
  - [x] Every major event (session start, AI response, tool call, error) emits a notification
  - [x] Use mocks in tests to verify delegate calls
  - [x] Document which events are emitted and when

---

## 7. Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [x] **Test and handle errors**
  - [x] Invalid input
  - [x] Tool failures
  - [x] AI service errors
  - [x] Ensure errors are reported via delegates and do not crash the loop
  - [x] Add/expand tests for error and edge case handling

---

## 8. Documentation and Cleanup

- [x] **Document public methods and expected delegate events**
- [x] Remove or refactor obsolete code from the old interactive mode
- [x] Update inline comments and docstrings for clarity

---

## 9. Final Review

- [x] **All tests passing**
- [x] Code reviewed and approved
- [x] Ready for integration with interactive mode backend

---

**Tips:**

- Work in small, test-driven increments.
- Use mocks for delegates and tools to isolate AILoop logic.
- Update this checklist as you
