# Async Agents Phase 2: Implementation Logbook

## Goal
Integrate async agents with channel response system and implement proper async AI processing.

## Session 1: Starting Phase 2 (2025-01-06)

### Current Analysis
Looking at the current `_process_task` implementation in async_session_manager_v2.py:
- Uses `run_in_executor` for synchronous processing
- No WebSocket notifications for results
- No channel response handling
- Basic continuation support

### First Task: Add WebSocket Integration
Need to:
1. Pass WebSocket reference to AsyncAgentSessionManager
2. Add notification methods for task events
3. Parse and forward channel responses

## Implementation Progress

### 1. WebSocket Integration Planning
The current architecture:
- AsyncAgentEndpoints has access to WebSocket via handlers
- AsyncAgentSessionManager is created without WebSocket reference
- Need to establish communication path

Options:
1. Pass WebSocket to manager on creation
2. Use event system with callbacks
3. Create notification service

Decision: Use callback system to maintain separation of concerns.

### 2. Files to Modify
- [ ] async_session_manager_v2.py - Add callback support
- [ ] async_agent_endpoints.py - Register callbacks
- [ ] Create notification types

## Next Steps
1. Add callback system to AsyncAgentSessionManager
2. Create WebSocket notification methods
3. Test with real agent task processing

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Added Notification Callback System (COMPLETE)
- Modified AsyncAgentSessionManager to accept notification_callback parameter
- Created _send_notification method for WebSocket events
- Added _extract_channel_response to parse AI responses

### 2. Updated Task Processing (COMPLETE)
- Added task.started notification when processing begins
- Added task.completed notification with channel response
- Added task.continuation notification for multi-step tasks
- Added task.error notification on failures

### 3. WebSocket Integration (COMPLETE)
- Updated AsyncAgentEndpoints._get_or_create_manager to create callback
- Callback sends JSON-RPC notifications via WebSocket
- All async endpoints now pass websocket parameter

### 4. Notification Types Implemented
- `async.task.started` - Task processing begins
- `async.task.completed` - Task completes with result
- `async.task.continuation` - Continuation queued
- `async.task.error` - Task processing error

## Testing Required
Need to test that WebSocket notifications are properly sent during task processing.

## Issues Found During Testing

### 1. AgentContext.update() Missing (FIXED)
- AgentContext doesn't have an update method
- Fixed by checking for method existence and setting attributes directly

### 2. Coroutine Not Awaited
- Error: "Object of type coroutine is not JSON serializable"
- The run_in_executor is returning a coroutine instead of result
- Need to properly handle async execution

### 3. Notification Callback Issue
- The sessionId is being added in the callback but test expects it in params
- May need to adjust test expectations or notification format
