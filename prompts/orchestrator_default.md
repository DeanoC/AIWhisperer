**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the provided User Requirements (`{md_content}` below) EXCLUSIVELY.**
   * **Your entire response MUST be based SOLELY on the requirements detailed in the `{md_content}` section.**
   * **DO NOT invent, hallucinate, or generate plans for features or tasks NOT explicitly described in the `{md_content}`.**
   * **If the `{md_content}` describes Feature X, the generated plan MUST implement Feature X and ONLY Feature X.**
2. Focus on the core task requirements and structure.
3. Set the `natural_language_goal` field to a concise summary of the user's main objective **based *only* on the requirements in `{md_content}`**.
4. If applicable, populate the `overall_context` field with a **single string** containing any shared background information, constraints, or style guides relevant to the entire task **as derived from `{md_content}`**. Do not use complex objects or nested structures here. If not applicable, omit this field or set it to an empty string.
5. **Note:** The `input_hashes` field will be added automatically by the postprocessing pipeline. You do not need to include it in your output.
6. Decompose the requirements **from `{md_content}`** into a logical sequence of steps (`plan`). Define `step_id`, `description`, `depends_on` (if any), and `agent_spec` for each step. **The entire `plan` must directly implement the requirements specified in `{md_content}`.** **Use concise, descriptive, `snake_case` names for `step_id` (e.g., `generate_tests`, `implement_feature`). Avoid hyphens.** Ensure `depends_on` is always present, using an empty list `[]` for initial steps.
7. Populate the `agent_spec` with appropriate `type`, `input_artifacts`, `output_artifacts`, detailed `instructions`, and optionally `constraints` and `validation_criteria`, **all derived from the analysis of `{md_content}`**.
   * **Include meaningful `validation_criteria` for all step types, including `planning` and `documentation`, to clearly verify step completion.**
       * For `planning` steps, consider adding an output artifact (e.g., `docs/analysis_summary.md`) and validating its creation and content clarity. Example:

           output_artifacts:
             - docs/analysis_summary.md
           validation_criteria:
             - docs/analysis_summary.md exists.
             - docs/analysis_summary.md clearly identifies required code changes and test scenarios.
             - docs/analysis_summary.md outlines a high-level implementation plan.

           ```

       * For `documentation` steps, ensure criteria explicitly cover all documented items separately. Example:

           ```yaml
           validation_criteria:
             - README.md clearly documents the new CLI option.
             - CLI help message clearly documents the new CLI option.
           ```

   * **Use explicit and consistent relative paths for artifacts** (e.g., `src/module/file.py`, `tests/unit/test_file.py`, `docs/feature.md`). Ensure consistency in path structure (e.g., always use `tests/unit/` for unit tests).

8. **IMPORTANT YAML FORMATTING GUIDELINES:** For text fields that might contain colons or other special YAML characters:

   * For `overall_context`, always use block scalar format with pipe:

   ```yaml
   overall_context: |
     This is text with special characters: colons, dashes, etc.
     The pipe character ensures proper parsing.
   ```

  * Similarly for `agent_spec.instructions`:

   ```yaml
   instructions: |
     Step 1: Do this first.
     Step 2: Then do this next.
   ```

9. **Prioritize Agent Types:** When assigning the `agent_spec.type`, prioritize using types from the following list where applicable:
   * `planning`: For steps involving breaking down tasks, analyzing requirements, or designing approaches.
   * `code_generation`: For steps that write new code files or significant code blocks.
   * `test_generation`: Specifically for generating unit tests or test cases.
   * `file_edit`: For steps that modify existing files (code, configuration, documentation). Use this instead of `code_generation` for modifications.
   * `validation`: For steps that check code quality, run tests, or verify outputs against criteria (e.g., linting, testing execution, schema validation).
   * `documentation`: For steps focused on writing or updating documentation (READMEs, docstrings, comments).
   * `file_io`: For basic file operations like creating directories, moving files, etc., if needed as separate steps.
   * `analysis`: For steps focused on understanding existing code or data before modification or generation.
   * `refinement`: For steps specifically designed to improve or correct the output of a previous step based on feedback or validation results.
   If none of these fit well, you may use another descriptive type.
10. **Strict Test-Driven Development (TDD):** This project MANDATES a strict TDD methodology. For **any** step involving the creation or modification of executable code (i.e., `type: 'code_generation'` or `type: 'file_edit'`) **required by `{md_content}`**:

* **Test Generation First:** The plan **must** include a dedicated step (`type: 'test_generation'`) that **strictly precedes** the corresponding `code_generation` or `file_edit` step in the plan sequence. This test step must generate tests specifically for the code that will be created or modified in the subsequent step.
* **Dependency on Tests:** The `code_generation` or `file_edit` step **must** list the corresponding `test_generation` step ID in its `depends_on` list.
* **Validation After:** Following the `code_generation` or `file_edit` step, the plan **must** include a dedicated step (`type: 'validation'`) responsible for executing the specific tests generated in the preceding `test_generation` step. This validation step **must** depend on the `code_generation` or `file_edit` step.
* **Test Generation Instructions:** The `test_generation` step's instructions should emphasize creating tests that thoroughly verify the requirements for the *specific code being generated/modified in the next step*. Avoid special casing (e.g., use randomized or varied inputs/identifiers where appropriate, not just fixed examples). Its `validation_criteria` must ensure the test file(s) are created or updated appropriately (e.g., `tests/unit/test_my_feature.py exists`, `tests/unit/test_my_feature.py contains test_new_functionality`).
* **Validation Instructions:** The `validation` step's instructions must specify running the relevant tests generated in the preceding test step (e.g., using `pytest tests/unit/test_my_feature.py::test_new_functionality`). Its `validation_criteria` must confirm that the test execution command runs successfully and that the specific tests pass (e.g., `pytest tests/unit/test_my_feature.py::test_new_functionality executes successfully`, `Test test_new_functionality in tests/unit/test_my_feature.py passes`).
* **Code/Edit Agent Instructions:** The instructions for the `code_generation` or `file_edit` agent **must** explicitly forbid implementing code that *only* passes the specific generated tests (i.e., no special-case logic tailored solely to the tests). The code must correctly implement the required functionality as described in the requirements.

11. **Code Reuse:** For steps with `type: 'code_generation'` or `type: 'file_edit'` **required by `{md_content}`**, ensure the `agent_spec.instructions` explicitly directs the executor agent to:

* First, examine the existing codebase (especially potentially relevant utility modules like `utils.py`, `config.py`, `exceptions.py`, etc.) for functions, classes, constants, or custom exceptions that can be reused to fulfill the task. **Mention specific potentially relevant modules (including `exceptions.py` if error handling is involved) in the instructions.**
* Only implement new logic if suitable existing code cannot be found or adapted.
* If reusing code, ensure it's imported and used correctly according to project conventions.

12. **YAML Syntax for Strings:** Pay close attention to valid YAML syntax. **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT use markdown-style backticks (`) within simple YAML string values.** This applies especially to list items in fields like`validation_criteria`,`constraints`,`input_artifacts`, and`output_artifacts`.

* **Correct:** Use plain strings (e.g., `README.md`) or standard YAML single/double quotes (`'README.md'`, `"src/main.py"`) when referring to files or code elements in these lists.
* **Incorrect (DO NOT DO THIS):**

       ```yaml
       validation_criteria:
         - `README.md` contains documentation # INVALID YAML
         - Check `src/main.py` for changes # INVALID YAML
       ```

* **Correct Example:**

       ```yaml
       validation_criteria:
         - "README.md contains documentation"
         - Check 'src/main.py' for changes
         - Output file output/result.txt exists
       ```

* Backticks (`) are ONLY acceptable when they are part of the *content* of a properly formatted YAML multi-line block scalar (like the`instructions` field, which uses `|` or `>`).

13. Format the `description` and `instructions` fields clearly and actionably. **Crucially, the `instructions` field MUST be a single YAML string.** Use YAML multi-line string syntax (`|` or `>`) and internal markdown formatting (e.g., bullet points, numbered lists, and backticks for code elements *within this block*) within that single string for clarity, similar to the project's planning documents.

* **Example of correct multi-line instructions string:**

       ```yaml
       instructions: |
         # Action 1
         Update the file `config.py` based on X.
         - Detail A
         - Detail B
         # Action 2
         Generate the second file using Y.
       ```

* **Do NOT generate a YAML list like `instructions: ['Line 1', 'Line 2']`.**

14. **YAML Structure:** Ensure the generated YAML is perfectly valid. Each top-level key (`task_id`, `natural_language_goal`, `overall_context`, `input_hashes`, `plan`) **MUST** start on a new line. Do not place multiple top-level keys on the same line. Indentation must be consistent (typically 2 spaces).
