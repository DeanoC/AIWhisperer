# Requirements for yaml_clean_postprocessor Configuration

This document outlines the requirements for a YAML cleaning script postprocessing step, integrated into the project's standard script postprocessing system.

## Goal

The primary goal is to create a script postprocessing module that cleans AI-generated YAML, removing common formatting artifacts and errors before further processing.

## Scope

### Initial Implementation

1. **Remove Code Fences:** Detect and remove leading/trailing YAML code fences (```yaml ... ```) or simple fences (``` ... ```) from the input string.
2. **Input:** The script will receive the raw AI-generated YAML content as a string.
3. **Output:** The script will output the cleaned YAML string.
4. **Error Handling:** If processing fails unexpectedly, the script should log an error and return the original, unmodified input string.

### Potential Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Version):

* Trimming leading/trailing whitespace from the entire content.
* Trimming leading/trailing whitespace from individual lines.
* Basic YAML syntax check (e.g., ensuring it can be parsed).
* Normalization of inconsistent indentation (if feasible and safe).

Whilst not a part of this task, it should be designed to support other cleaning such as normalizing indentation and running and fixes linkter errors.

## Integration

This script will be invoked by the existing project `src/postprocessing/postprocessing_pipelien.py`. Configuration details (e.g., script path, activation flags) will follow the standard postprocessing module conventions outlined in `docs/postprocessing_design.md`.
