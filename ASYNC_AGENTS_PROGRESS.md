# Async Agents Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

### 1. Synchronous Mail Switching (`send_mail_with_switch`)
- ✅ Created `SendMailWithSwitchTool` that enables synchronous agent communication
- ✅ Tool sends mail and returns metadata for agent switching
- ✅ Integrated with mailbox system for message delivery

### 2. Agent Switch Handler
- ✅ Created `AgentSwitchHandler` class to manage synchronous agent switches
- ✅ Detects successful mail sends requiring agent switches
- ✅ Performs agent context switching and restoration
- ✅ Maintains switch stack for nested agent calls

### 3. Circular Mail Detection
- ✅ Implemented maximum switch depth (5) to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ Added immediate circular reference detection (agent sending to self)
- ✅ Added circular loop detection (agent already in switch stack)
- ✅ Clear error messages for circular mail scenarios

### 4. Centralized Agent Name Resolution
- ✅ Enhanced `AgentRegistry` with name-to-ID mapping
- ✅ Added `resolve_agent_name_to_id()` method for consistent resolution
- ✅ Supports various agent name formats (full names, first names, roles)
- ✅ Integrated with `AgentSwitchHandler` for reliable agent resolution

### 5. Per-Agent Debug Logging
- ✅ Created `AgentLogger` class for separate agent log files
- ✅ Each agent gets timestamped log in `logs/agents/`
- ✅ Logs agent creation, switches, messages, and tool calls
- ✅ Integrated with session manager and switch handler
- ✅ Helps debug complex multi-agent interactions

## Known Issues

### 1. Agent Mail Processing
- ❌ Debbie doesn't automatically check mailbox when switched to
- ❌ Agents receive switch notification but don't process mail content
- ❌ Need to update agent prompts to include mailbox checking protocol

### 2. Tool Registration
- ⚠️ `send_mail_with_switch` tool needs explicit registration in some contexts
- ⚠️ Tool may not be available to all agents by default

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Agent Mail Processing
- Update Debbie's prompt to automatically check mailbox on switch
- Ensure all agents follow mailbox protocol when activated
- Test multi-hop mail chains (A → D → P → D → A)

### 2. Complete Async Agent Implementation
- Implement true async background agent execution
- Create agent session manager for parallel AI loops
- Add WebSocket notifications for async agent updates

### 3. Testing & Documentation
- Create comprehensive test suite for agent switching
- Test circular mail prevention thoroughly
- Document the async agents feature for users

## Architecture Notes

The synchronous mail switching works as follows:
1. Agent A calls `send_mail_with_switch(to_agent="B", ...)`
2. Tool returns success with `agent_switch_required: True`
3. `AgentSwitchHandler` detects this and switches to Agent B
4. Agent B should check mailbox and process the request
5. System switches back to Agent A with the response

The agent logging provides visibility into:
- When agents are created and with what configuration
- All messages (user input, AI responses, tool calls)
- Agent switches with reasons
- Actions taken by each agent

This foundation enables both synchronous (switch and wait) and asynchronous (fire and forget) agent communication patterns.
