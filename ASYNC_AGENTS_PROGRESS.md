# Async Agents Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

### 1. Synchronous Mail Switching (`send_mail_with_switch`)
- ✅ Created `SendMailWithSwitchTool` that enables synchronous agent communication
- ✅ Tool sends mail and returns metadata for agent switching
- ✅ Integrated with mailbox system for message delivery

### 2. Agent Switch Handler
- ✅ Created `AgentSwitchHandler` class to manage synchronous agent switches
- ✅ Detects successful mail sends requiring agent switches
- ✅ Performs agent context switching and restoration
- ✅ Maintains switch stack for nested agent calls

### 3. Circular Mail Detection
- ✅ Implemented maximum switch depth (5) to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ Added immediate circular reference detection (agent sending to self)
- ✅ Added circular loop detection (agent already in switch stack)
- ✅ Clear error messages for circular mail scenarios

### 4. Centralized Agent Name Resolution
- ✅ Enhanced `AgentRegistry` with name-to-ID mapping
- ✅ Added `resolve_agent_name_to_id()` method for consistent resolution
- ✅ Supports various agent name formats (full names, first names, roles)
- ✅ Integrated with `AgentSwitchHandler` for reliable agent resolution

### 5. Per-Agent Debug Logging
- ✅ Created `AgentLogger` class for separate agent log files
- ✅ Each agent gets timestamped log in `logs/agents/`
- ✅ Logs agent creation, switches, messages, and tool calls
- ✅ Integrated with session manager and switch handler
- ✅ Helps debug complex multi-agent interactions

## Recently Fixed Issues

### 1. Agent Mail Processing (FIXED)
- ✅ Fixed the core issue preventing tool execution during continuations
- ✅ Removed `is_continuation` restriction that was blocking tool calls
- ✅ Agents now properly process mail content and execute requested tools
- ✅ Verified with multiple test cases including tool requests via mail

### 2. Async Agent Endpoint Parameter Issue (FIXED)
- ✅ Fixed parameter mismatch in AsyncAgentEndpoints methods
- ✅ All async endpoint methods now accept `websocket=None` parameter
- ✅ Matches WebSocket handler signature requirements

### 3. WebSocket Client DEBUG Logging (FIXED)
- ✅ Added logging suppression for websocket.client and related loggers
- ✅ Reduces log spam from DEBUG level websocket messages
- ✅ Configured in core logging setup

### 4. AsyncAgentSessionManager Configuration (FIXED)
- ✅ Fixed to use AgentRegistry instead of non-existent AgentFactory method
- ✅ Properly loads agent prompts using PromptSystem
- ✅ Creates AI loops using AILoopFactory
- ✅ Fixed StatelessAgent initialization with correct parameters

## Known Issues

### 1. Tool Registration
- ⚠️ `send_mail_with_switch` tool needs explicit registration in some contexts
- ⚠️ Tool may not be available to all agents by default

### 2. Server Restart Required
- ⚠️ Server needs to be restarted to pick up async agent fixes
- ⚠️ See ASYNC_AGENTS_SERVER_RESTART_NEEDED.md for details

## Recently Discovered: Async Implementation Already Present!

### 6. Async Agent Architecture (IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ `AsyncAgentSessionManager` - Manages multiple concurrent agent sessions
- ✅ Background agent processors - Each agent runs its own loop
- ✅ Mailbox integration - Agents check mailbox automatically
- ✅ Sleep/wake functionality - Timer and event-based wake
- ✅ Task queues per agent - Independent task processing
- ✅ WebSocket endpoints - Full API for async agent management

### Available WebSocket Methods:
- `async.createAgent` - Create new async agent session
- `async.startAgent` - Start agent's background processor
- `async.stopAgent` - Stop an agent
- `async.sleepAgent` - Put agent to sleep with wake conditions
- `async.wakeAgent` - Wake a sleeping agent
- `async.sendTask` - Send direct task to agent
- `async.getAgentStates` - Get states of all agents
- `async.broadcastEvent` - Broadcast event to listening agents

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Async Agent Implementation
- Create test scenarios for multi-agent workflows
- Test sleep/wake functionality
- Verify mailbox-based coordination
- Test resource limits and cleanup

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test async agents with synchronous mail switching
- Verify both patterns work together
- Test complex multi-agent workflows

### 3. Documentation
- Document async agent API
- Create usage examples
- Update user guide with async patterns

## Architecture Notes

The synchronous mail switching works as follows:
1. Agent A calls `send_mail_with_switch(to_agent="B", ...)`
2. Tool returns success with `agent_switch_required: True`
3. `AgentSwitchHandler` detects this and switches to Agent B
4. Agent B checks mailbox and processes the request (now working correctly)
5. System switches back to Agent A with the response

### Mail Processing Fix Details
The original implementation had `is_continuation=True` in agent_switch_handler.py which prevented tool execution during agent switches. This was due to a design flaw where continuations were assumed to not need tools. The fix involved:
1. Changing to `is_continuation=False` in agent_switch_handler.py (line 171)
2. Removing the `not is_continuation` check in stateless_session_manager.py (line 991)

This allows the full OpenRouter tool calling flow (API call → tool execution → second API call) to work correctly during agent switches.

The agent logging provides visibility into:
- When agents are created and with what configuration
- All messages (user input, AI responses, tool calls)
- Agent switches with reasons
- Actions taken by each agent

This foundation enables both synchronous (switch and wait) and asynchronous (fire and forget) agent communication patterns.
