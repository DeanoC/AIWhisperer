# RFC: Add More Cat Icons to Project

**RFC ID**: RFC-2025-05-31-0001
**Status**: in_progress
**Created**: 2025-05-31 05:10:13
P25-05-31 05:11:46
**Author**: User

## Summary
<!-- Brief overview of the feature/idea in 1-2 paragraphs -->
Expand the project's cat icon collection to provide users with more feline-themed visual options and improve the overall user experience with adorable cat imagery

## Background
## Project Context
AI Whisperer is a Python-based AI development assistant with both command-line and interactive web interfaces. The project features:
- **Dual Interface**: Command-line tool for batch processing and interactive web UI for real-time development
- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized AI agents (Alice the Assistant, Patricia the Planner, Tessa the Tester)
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript application with Material-UI components
- **Backend**: FastAPI server with WebSocket support

## Motivation for Cat Icons
Users love cat icons and having more variety would enhance the visual appeal and user engagement of the project. Given that AI Whisperer is a development tool used by developers who often appreciate fun, personality-filled interfaces, adding diverse cat icons would:
- Provide delightful visual elements in the React frontend
- Allow users to personalize their experience with cat avatars/icons
- Add character to the multi-agent system (agents could have cat representations)
- Enhance the overall user experience with adorable cat imagery that makes the development process more enjoyable

The project already uses a modern React/TypeScript frontend with Material-UI, making it an ideal platform for implementing a rich cat icon system.
## Requirements
- [ ] Add at least 10 new cat icons in various styles
- [ ] Ensure icons are consistent with existing design system
- [ ] Support multiple file formats (SVG, PNG)
- [ ] Include different cat poses and expressions
- [ ] Maintain high quality and scalability
- [ ] Include diverse cat breeds and patterns:
  - [ ] Tabby cats (striped patterns)
  - [ ] Tuxedo cats (black and white formal markings)
  - [ ] Calico cats (tri-color patches)
  - [ ] Solid color cats (black, white, gray, orange)
  - [ ] Siamese/pointed cats
  - [ ] Long-haired and short-haired variants
- [ ] Include specific pattern variations:
  - [ ] Black and white "moggy" with white nose stripe (like Stripy!)
  - [ ] Classic tabby stripes
  - [ ] White socks/mittens patterns
  - [ ] Facial markings and unique features
- [ ] Ensure each breed/pattern has multiple poses available
## Technical Considerations
## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture (React/TypeScript)
- **Icon Storage**: Create `frontend/src/assets/icons/cats/` directory structure
- **Component Integration**: Develop React components for cat icon display and selection
- **TypeScript Support**: Define interfaces for icon metadata and props
- **CSS Integration**: Establish consistent styling classes and size variants

### File Organization
```
frontend/src/assets/icons/cats/
├── svg/           # Vector icons for scalability
├── png/           # Raster fallbacks
└── index.ts       # Icon registry and exports
```

### Icon Specifications
- **Formats**: Primary SVG, PNG fallbacks (24x24, 32x32, 64x64px)
- **Style Guidelines**: Consistent line weight, color palette, artistic approach
- **Naming Convention**: `cat-[pose/action]-[variant].svg` (e.g., `cat-sitting-happy.svg`)

### Backend Considerations (FastAPI)
- **Static Serving**: Configure static file serving for icon assets
- **API Endpoints**: Optional `/api/icons/cats` endpoint for dynamic icon discovery
- **Metadata Management**: JSON configuration for icon categories and descriptions

### Integration Points
- **Existing CSS**: Leverage current styling system in `frontend/src/*.css`
- **Component Library**: Follow existing React component patterns
- **Asset Pipeline**: Integrate with current build process
