# RFC: Test RFC: All About Kitties

**RFC ID**: RFC-2025-06-02-0001
**Status**: in_progress
**Created**: 2025-06-02 11:30:09

**Author**: User

## Summary
This RFC defines 'kitties' metaphorically as highly effective QA testers. Their primary functions are:
- **Stomping on keyboards**: Generating random inputs to test system robustness and edge cases.
- **Catching mice**: Identifying and reporting bugs, unexpected behavior, or system failures.
## Background

As part of ongoing system improvements, we are testing the RFC creation process to ensure it integrates correctly with our refactoring efforts.

## Requirements
- [ ] Verify RFC creation
- [ ] Confirm RFC content storage
- [ ] Test RFC listing and reading functionality
-   **Visual Bug Detection**: "Kitties" (QA testers) will primarily focus on visual inspection of the User Interface (UI) to detect anomalies and unexpected behavior.
-   **Dynamic Anomaly Logging**: Any visual element that "moves" unexpectedly or behaves erratically on the UI should be considered a "mouse" (bug).
-   **Keyboard-Stomp Logging**: Detected "mice" will be logged by the "kitties" through a mechanism equivalent to "stomping on the keyboard," implying a direct, possibly manual, input method for bug reporting.
