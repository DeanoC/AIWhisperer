# RFC: Enhanced Chat Icons for Better User Expression

**RFC ID**: RFC-2025-05-31-0001
**Status**: in_progress
**Created**: 2025-05-31 08:51:43

**Author**: User

## Summary

Add a comprehensive set of chat icons/emojis to improve user communication and expression capabilities in the chat interface

## Background

Current chat interface may have limited visual expression options. Adding more diverse chat icons would enhance user experience and communication richness.

## Requirements
- Expand the available chat icon/emoji set with focus on cat breeds
- Support different cat breed representations (Persian, Siamese, Maine Coon, British Shorthair, etc.)
- Ensure icons are accessible and properly sized for chat interface
- Maintain consistent visual style with existing UI components
- Integrate seamlessly with current codebase architecture
- Support different categories of expressions beyond cat breeds
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing chat functionality
## Technical Considerations
## Architecture Integration
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript components (55 TSX files)
- **Backend**: FastAPI Python service (274 Python files)
- **Styling**: CSS modules (21 CSS files including MessageInput.css)

## Implementation Approach
- Create React component for cat breed icon picker/selector
- Integrate with existing MessageInput component
- Maintain consistent styling with current CSS architecture
- Consider icon storage: embedded SVGs vs external icon library
- Ensure accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Technical Dependencies
- React TypeScript ecosystem
- Existing CSS styling patterns
- Current message handling pipeline
- Backend API integration if icons need server-side processing
## Implementation Approach

*To be defined during refinement*

## Open Questions
1. Which specific cat breeds should be included in the initial release?
2. Should icons be clickable from a picker/dropdown or typed as shortcuts (e.g., :persian:)?
3. How should icons be sized and positioned within chat messages?
4. Should there be search/filter functionality for finding specific breeds?
5. Do we need custom cat breed icons or can we use existing emoji/icon libraries?
6. Should icons be stored locally or fetched from external sources?
7. How should the feature handle mobile vs desktop interfaces?
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cat breed icons are visually distinct and recognizable
- [ ] Icon picker integrates seamlessly with existing MessageInput component
- [ ] Icons display correctly in chat messages with proper sizing
- [ ] Feature works on both desktop and mobile interfaces
- [ ] Accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers
- [ ] No performance degradation in chat interface
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with existing chat functionality
- [ ] At least 10 popular cat breeds represented in initial release
- [ ] Icons follow consistent visual style with current UI
- [ ] Feature can be easily extended with additional icon categories
