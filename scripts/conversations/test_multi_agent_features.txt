Hi Alice! Can you tell me which AI model you're using?

Great! Now I need help creating an RFC for a new authentication system. Can you switch me to Patricia?

Thanks Patricia! Please create an RFC for implementing OAuth2 authentication with the following requirements:
- Support for Google and GitHub providers
- JWT token management
- Refresh token rotation
- Session management

Perfect! Now I need some technical expertise. Can you get Eamonn to review this?

Hi Eamonn! Can you tell me which AI model you're using and review the authentication RFC Patricia just created?
