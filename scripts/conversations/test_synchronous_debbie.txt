Hi Debbie, I need your help debugging something. Can you check if you have any messages in your mailbox?

Debbie, can you analyze the current workspace and tell me about the project structure?

Now can you search for all test files and count them? Look for files matching the pattern *test*.py

Can you check the session health and tell me if everything is running smoothly?
