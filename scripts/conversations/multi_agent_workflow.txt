# Multi-Agent Workflow Conversation
# This shows how to work with multiple agents in sequence

# Start with Patricia for RFC creation
Please switch to agent P (Patricia)

Patricia, I need an RFC for a simple user authentication system with email and password

# Now switch to agent E to decompose it
Please switch to agent E (Eamonn)

Eamonn, can you take the RFC that Patricia just created and break it down into tasks for external agents?

# Switch to Debbie to check everything is working
Please switch to agent D (Debbie)

Debbie, can you verify that the RFC and task decomposition were created successfully?
