Alice, please use send_mail_with_switch to ask Debbie to analyze our test coverage. Ask her to be specific about which areas need more tests.

What did Debbie find? 

Based on Debbie's analysis, can you ask Patricia to create an RFC for improving our test coverage? Use send_mail_with_switch so we get Patricia's immediate input.

Excellent! What did Patricia propose in her RFC?
