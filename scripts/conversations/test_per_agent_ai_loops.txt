# Test Per-Agent AI Loops
# This conversation script tests that each agent uses its configured AI model

USER: Hi Debbie! Let's test the per-agent AI loops feature. First, can you check which AI models are configured for each agent?

AGENT: @d

USER: Can you use the ai_loop_inspector tool to see the current AI loop configurations?

WAIT: 3

USER: Great! Now let's switch between agents and verify each one uses the correct model. First, let's check Alice.

AGENT: @a

USER: What AI model are you using, Alice?

WAIT: 2

USER: Now let's switch to Eamonn and check his model.

AGENT: @e  

USER: Hi Eamonn! What AI model are you using for task decomposition?

WAIT: 2

USER: Let's go back to Debbie to inspect the AI loops again.

AGENT: @d

USER: Debbie, can you use the ai_loop_inspector tool with include_details=True to show me all the active AI loops and verify:
1. Alice uses the default model
2. Debbie (you) uses gpt-3.5-turbo with temperature 0.5
3. Eamonn uses claude-3-opus with 8000 max tokens

WAIT: 5

USER: Perfect! Can you also check which agents have custom models vs default models?

WAIT: 3

USER: Excellent test! The per-agent AI loops are working correctly. Each agent is using its configured AI model.
