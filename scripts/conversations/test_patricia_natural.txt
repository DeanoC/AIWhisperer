# Test Patricia RFC Creation - Natural Language Version
# Alice should understand and help us switch to Patricia

Hi! I need help creating some RFCs. Can you connect me with Patricia the Planner?

I'd like Patricia to create an RFC for adding a terminal feature to the frontend. Patricia, when you create it, please first explain what you're going to do.

Patricia, did you create the RFC? Can you show me what was created?

Patricia, let's create another RFC for a file browser component in the frontend. Again, please tell me your plan before creating it.

Patricia, can you list all the RFCs to confirm both were created?
