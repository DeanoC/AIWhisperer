# Test Patricia directly by starting with her

@Patricia, I need to create an RFC for implementing a terminal feature in the frontend.

Before you create it, can you tell me what you're going to do?

Now please create the RFC for the terminal feature.

Great! Can you show me what was created using read_rfc?

Let's create another one. Please create an RFC for adding a file browser to the frontend. Again, explain what you'll do first.

Can you list all the RFCs we have now?
