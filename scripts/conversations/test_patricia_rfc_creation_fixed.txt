# Test Patricia RFC Creation - Fixed Version
# First ask Alice to switch to Patricia, then test RFC creation

Hi Alice! Can you please switch me to Patricia? I need to create some RFCs.

Please create an RFC for implementing a terminal feature in the frontend. Make sure to explain what you're doing before you create it.

Did you create the RFC? Can you show me what was created?

Let's test again. Can you create another RFC for adding a file browser component to the frontend? Please tell me what you're going to do first.

Great! Can you list all RFCs now to confirm both were created?
