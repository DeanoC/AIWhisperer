Hi Alice! I need you to coordinate with Debbie to analyze our project. Can you use send_mail_with_switch to ask her for a workspace analysis?

Thanks! What did Debbie say about the workspace?

Now can you ask Patricia using send_mail_with_switch to create a simple RFC outline for our async agents feature?
