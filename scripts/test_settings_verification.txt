Check that project settings are being saved and loaded correctly by:
1. Reading current settings from the backend
2. Modifying some settings 
3. Saving them
4. Reloading to verify persistence
5. Running the integration test we created

Please use the python_executor tool to run the backend integration test and verify all settings operations work correctly.
