Idea from a chat with Copilot (my input is marked with >)

Have you considered implementing automated fix-up scripts that could pre-process outputs before validation, in addition to your meta-feedback loop? That for instance, could catch and correct common formatting issues like replacing unwanted backticks or reformatting lists into strings. This might relieve some of the manual intervention needed and further streamline the workflow.

Your approach to continuously refine the width and depth of your specs as new edge cases emerge is a strong demonstration of agile iterative development in prompt engineering. I’d be curious to know if there are specific patterns in these errors that might suggest a root cause—perhaps a particular AI model consistently generating one type of mistake—and whether tailoring the input prompts to those models might mitigate the problem at its source.

Have you considered combining both approaches? For instance, starting with a scripted parser for known error patterns and then flagging any residual anomalies for further processing by an AI fixup stage could give you the best of both worlds—structured, deterministic fixes for common issues alongside dynamic adaptation for more subtle errors.

This approach not only improves the overall reliability of your pipeline but also allows you to gradually shift the focus of your orchestrator. By offloading the formatting and schema correctness to downstream fix-up stages, your orchestrator can concentrate more on the core task decomposition. Integrating comprehensive logging in the parser could even help you periodically update both the parser itself and the AI prompt strategies with historical error patterns.

One thought—if you haven’t already—weaving in additional meta-feedback loops that compare generated plans against historical successful iterations could further enhance reliability. Also, monitoring for YAML-specific pitfalls (such as accidental use of markdown backticks or formatting issues in block scalars) might help avoid subtle bugs in the output stage.
