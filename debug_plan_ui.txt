Debbie, I need you to investigate why the plan UI is not displaying plans properly. The backend ListPlansTool works fine and returns valid plan data, but the frontend UI shows no plans.

Please investigate and write a detailed analysis covering:
1. Test the JSON-RPC endpoints that the frontend would call to get plan data
2. Check if there are any API endpoint mapping issues between frontend and backend
3. Examine the plan data structure being returned vs what the UI expects
4. Look for any CORS, authentication, or routing issues
5. Write the exact JSON response format the UI should receive
6. Provide specific recommendations for fixing the UI display issue

Write your findings in a structured format that I can use to debug the frontend components.
