# Streaming and JSON Display Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSON Structured Output Display During Streaming
**Problem**: When structured output is enabled, the raw JSON was being displayed during streaming instead of the extracted content.

**Fix in `interactive_server/stateless_session_manager.py`**:
- Enhanced the `send_chunk` function to detect and parse structured JSON responses during streaming
- Added logic to extract the `response` or `final` field from JSON for display
- Handles partial JSON by using regex to extract content from incomplete JSON strings
- Properly unescapes JSON strings for correct display

### 2. Tool Calls Not Detected from Structured JSON
**Problem**: When tool calls are embedded in structured JSON responses, they weren't being properly detected and executed.

**Fixes**:
- Added parsing logic after `agent.process_message` to extract tool_calls from structured JSON
- Updated the response processing to check for tool_calls in parsed JSON and set `finish_reason` appropriately
- Enhanced the final message processing to handle both structured channel responses and continuation responses

### 3. Duplicate Channel Messages During Streaming
**Problem**: Streaming updates were creating duplicate channel messages in the frontend.

**Fixes in `frontend/src/services/aiService.ts`**:
- Updated streaming messages to use sequence `-1` and added `isStreaming: true` flag
- This allows the channel system to properly identify and update streaming messages

**Fixes in `frontend/src/hooks/useChannels.ts`**:
- Enhanced the channel message handler to properly detect streaming messages using the new flags
- Updated logic to replace streaming messages with final messages when they arrive

### 4. Integration of Channel Messages with Chat View
**Problem**: Channel messages weren't being displayed in the main chat view.

**Fix in `frontend/src/App.tsx`**:
- Added channel message handler that converts channel messages to chat messages
- Only processes 'final' channel messages to avoid duplication
- Properly handles streaming vs final messages
- Manages AI message lifecycle (start/append/finalize)

## Key Changes

1. **Backend (`stateless_session_manager.py`)**:
   - Enhanced streaming callback to parse and extract content from structured JSON
   - Added initial response parsing for structured output
   - Improved tool call detection from JSON responses

2. **Frontend (`aiService.ts`)**:
   - Marked streaming updates with special flags to distinguish from final messages

3. **Frontend (`useChannels.ts`)**:
   - Updated to handle the new streaming message format
   - Properly replaces streaming messages with final ones

4. **Frontend (`App.tsx`)**:
   - Added integration between channel system and chat display
   - Converts channel messages to AI chunks for display

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with structured output enabled models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4)
2. Verify tool calls are properly executed when embedded in JSON responses
3. Check that streaming displays readable content, not raw JSON
4. Ensure no duplicate messages appear in the chat
5. Test continuation protocol with structured output
