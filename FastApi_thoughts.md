# FastAPI with WebSockets for Interactive Mode: Analysis

## Summary

This document analyzes the suitability of using **FastAPI** with **WebSockets** for implementing the interactive mode backend in AIWhisperer, considering the project's current architecture and the message definitions outlined in `InteractiveAPI.def`.

---

## 1. Project Context

- **Current State:**  
  The backend is being refactored for modularity, async operations, and a delegate-based event system. The new interactive mode is designed to use structured, strongly-typed messages (see `InteractiveAPI.def`) for communication between a Python backend and a TypeScript frontend.
- **Requirements:**  
  - Real-time, bidirectional communication (AI responses, tool calls, status updates, etc.)
  - Strong typing and validation for messages
  - Async support for long-running AI operations
  - Scalability and maintainability

---

## 2. FastAPI + WebSockets: Fit for Purpose

### Pros

- **Native Async Support:**  
  FastAPI is built for async/await, matching the async nature of AIWhisperer’s core (AILoop, ExecutionEngine, etc.).
- **WebSocket Support:**  
  Enables real-time, bidirectional communication—ideal for streaming AI responses and live status updates.
- **Type Safety:**  
  Pydantic models can mirror your `.def` message definitions, ensuring strong validation and serialization.
- **Performance:**  
  FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks, suitable for interactive workloads.
- **Extensibility:**  
  Easy to add HTTP endpoints for health checks, admin, or future features.
- **Community & Ecosystem:**  
  Fast-growing, with good documentation and third-party support (e.g., `fastapi-jsonrpc`).

### Cons / Considerations

- **WebSocket State Management:**  
  You must manage per-connection state (sessions, authentication, etc.)—not handled automatically.
- **JSON-RPC over WebSocket:**  
  While FastAPI supports WebSockets natively, JSON-RPC protocol handling (batching, notifications, error codes) must be implemented or adapted from libraries.
- **Testing & Debugging:**  
  WebSocket and async code can be more complex to test and debug than synchronous HTTP endpoints.
- **Deployment:**  
  Requires an ASGI server (e.g., Uvicorn), which is standard but may differ from legacy WSGI setups.

## 3. Mapping `.def` Messages to FastAPI

- **Pydantic Models:**  
  Each message in `InteractiveAPI.def` can be mapped directly to a Pydantic model, ensuring type safety and validation.
- **Method Routing:**  
  JSON-RPC methods (e.g., `interactive.startSession`) can be dispatched to Python async functions, using a registry or manual dispatch.
- **Notifications:**  
  Server-initiated messages (e.g., streaming AI responses) are naturally supported via WebSockets.
- **Batching:**  
  If needed, batch requests can be handled by iterating over incoming lists.

---

## 4. Integration with Delegate System

- **DelegateManager:**  
  The delegate/event system can be adapted to emit notifications to connected WebSocket clients, using the same message types.
- **Session Management:**  
  Each WebSocket connection can be associated with a session, and delegates can push updates as events occur.

---

## 5. Alternatives

- **HTTP/REST:**  
  Not suitable for real-time, bidirectional communication.
- **Other Frameworks (e.g., Starlette, Sanic):**  
  Offer similar async and WebSocket support, but FastAPI’s type system and ecosystem are stronger.
- **Existing JSON-RPC Libraries:**  
  Some support HTTP only; WebSocket support is less common, but can be layered on top.

---

## 6. Conclusion & Recommendation

**FastAPI with WebSockets is highly appropriate for AIWhisperer’s interactive mode backend.**  
It aligns well with your async, event-driven architecture, and the message format can be directly mapped to Pydantic models for robust validation. Real-time updates, streaming, and bidirectional communication are all supported.

**Next Steps:**
- Prototype a FastAPI WebSocket server using Pydantic models generated from your `.def` files.
- Implement JSON-RPC method dispatch and notification sending.
- Integrate with the delegate system for event-driven updates.
- Plan for connection/session management and authentication as needed.

**In summary:**  
FastAPI + WebSockets is a modern, scalable, and maintainable choice for your interactive backend, and fits your message-driven, async-
