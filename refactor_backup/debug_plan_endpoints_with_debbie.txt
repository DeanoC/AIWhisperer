Hey Debbie! I need your help debugging a plan UI issue. Here's what's happening:

PROBLEM:
The frontend is calling JSON-RPC endpoints that don't seem to exist or aren't returning the expected data:
- Frontend calls: `plan.list` (expects response with `res.plans` array)
- Frontend calls: `plan.read` (expects response with `res.plan` object)

But the backend has tools named:
- `list_plans` 
- `read_plan`

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
1. Can you check what JSON-RPC endpoints are actually available in your server environment?
2. Are there `plan.list` and `plan.read` endpoints, or do they need to be created?
3. If the endpoints exist, can you test calling them and see what response format they return?
4. Can you check if there's a mapping layer between JSON-RPC endpoint names and tool names?
5. Test the actual `list_plans` and `read_plan` tools to see what data they return

GOAL:
Figure out if we need to:
- Create the missing JSON-RPC endpoints (`plan.list`, `plan.read`)
- Fix the response format to match what the frontend expects
- Or update the frontend to use the correct endpoint names

You have full access to the server internals, so you can test both the JSON-RPC layer and the underlying tools. Can you investigate this for me?
