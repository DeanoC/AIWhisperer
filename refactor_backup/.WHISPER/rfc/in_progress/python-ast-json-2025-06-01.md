## Summary

A feature that loads a Python model/module, parses its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and converts it into a structured JSON format for consumption by AI agents. This will enable agents to analyze, understand, and work with Python code structure programmatically.

## Background

AI agents need to understand code structure to perform various tasks like code analysis, refactoring, documentation generation, or code completion. Converting Python AST to JSON provides a standardized, language-agnostic format that agents can easily process and understand.

## Requirements
## Functional Requirements

### Core AST to JSON Conversion
- Load Python files or modules dynamically from file paths or module names
- Parse Python code into Abstract Syntax Tree using Python's `ast` module
- Convert AST nodes into structured JSON format with complete fidelity
- Handle all Python constructs (classes, functions, imports, decorators, etc.)
- Preserve source code metadata (line numbers, column offsets, docstrings)
- Export JSON to file or return as data structure

### Bidirectional Round-Trip Capability
- Convert JSON representation back to valid Python AST
- Regenerate Python source code from modified JSON structures
- Maintain code formatting preferences where possible
- Preserve comments and docstrings through the round-trip
- Validate JSON structure before conversion to prevent invalid Python generation
- Handle incremental modifications (partial JSON updates)

### Agent Integration
- Provide standardized JSON schema for AI agent consumption
- Include semantic metadata (function signatures, class hierarchies, dependencies)
- Support batch processing of multiple Python files
- Enable streaming for large codebases
- Provide error handling and validation feedback

### Quality & Performance
- Maintain 100% fidelity for round-trip conversions
- Handle edge cases in Python syntax gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages for invalid transformations
- Support Python 3.8+ syntax features
- Optimize for files up to 10MB in size
