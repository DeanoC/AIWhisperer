## Summary
Agent E - Eamonn The Executioner is a task decomposition specialist that takes structured plans from Agent P and breaks them down into highly detailed, actionable tasks with sufficient clarity and context for other agents to execute effectively.
## Background

AIWhisperer currently has Agent Patricia (P) for RFC creation and planning. To complete the development workflow, we need an execution agent that can take structured plans and automatically implement the tasks, following TDD principles and maintaining code quality standards.

## Requirements
## Core Task Decomposition
- Break down Agent P plans into granular, executable tasks
- Add sufficient context and detail for agent execution
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Specify required inputs, outputs, and dependencies

## Agent Orchestration Infrastructure
- **Agent Scheduling System**: Queue and dispatch tasks to available agents
- **Agent Registry**: Track available agents and their capabilities
- **Task Assignment Logic**: Match tasks to appropriate agent types
- **Concurrent Execution**: Handle multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Resource Management**: Prevent conflicts when agents modify same files

## Technical Considerations
## Agent Control Architecture

### Autonomous Agent Switching System
- **Agent-Initiated Control Transfer**: Agents can autonomously decide to hand off tasks to other specialized agents
- **Control Flow Management**: Clear protocols for when and how agents transfer control
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain full context and state when switching between agents
- **Decision Logic**: Framework for agents to evaluate which specialist agent is best suited for specific tasks

### Hierarchical Planning with Agent P Collaboration
- **Complex Plan Decomposition**: Agent E can engage Agent P to break down overly complex tasks into sub-plans
- **Recursive Planning**: Create nested RFC/plan structures for multi-layered projects
- **Collaborative Refinement**: Agent E and Agent P work together to clarify ambiguous requirements
- **Plan Splitting**: Automatically identify when a task requires its own RFC and planning cycle
- **Cross-Reference Management**: Maintain links between parent plans and sub-plans

### Synchronous Execution Model (Phase 1)
- **Sequential Task Processing**: One agent active at a time with full system control
- **Blocking Operations**: Current agent completes task before transferring control
- **Simplified State Management**: Single point of truth for system state

## Key Implementation Insights

### Start Small, Learn Fast
- Begin with a single, simple plan decomposition to understand real-world complexity
- Use actual external agent interactions to discover optimal task formatting
- Let usage patterns drive tool requirements rather than predicting them

### Agent Collaboration Patterns
- **Clarification Loops**: Agent E should frequently check with Agent P rather than making assumptions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain rich context across agent handoffs to prevent information loss
- **Failure Recovery**: Design for graceful degradation when agent communication fails

### External Agent Integration Philosophy
- **Agent-Agnostic Core**: Design internal task representation independent of external agent specifics
- **Adapter Pattern**: Create specialized adapters for each external agent type
- **Prompt Engineering**: Invest heavily in optimizing prompts for each external agent's strengths

### Quality and Safety First
- **Conservative Defaults**: Err on the side of too much detail rather than too little
- **Human Oversight**: Always provide clear points for human intervention and approval
- **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging of all agent decisions and actions for debugging and improvement
