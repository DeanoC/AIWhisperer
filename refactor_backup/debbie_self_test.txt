# Debbie Self-Test Script
# Use this script to test Debbie's tool usage after fixes

Hi Debbie! Please process the following test commands to verify your tool functionality:

1. Check your tool awareness: what debugging tools do you have available?

2. Test session health: use your session_health tool to check this session

3. Test global status: use your monitoring_control tool to check global monitoring status

4. Test session analysis: use your session_analysis tool to analyze recent activity

5. Run a comprehensive health check on this session

6. Show me what patterns you can detect in sessions

Please use your actual tools for each request and demonstrate your debugging capabilities.
