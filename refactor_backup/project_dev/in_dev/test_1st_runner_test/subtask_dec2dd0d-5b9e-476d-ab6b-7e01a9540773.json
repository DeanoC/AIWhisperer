    "Carefully read and understand the analysis provided in `docs/runner_test_analysis.md`. Pay close attention to the specific issues, missing functionalities, or required adjustments identified for running the '1st_runner_test' plan.",

    "Implement the identified code changes in the respective files. This may involve adding new functions, modifying existing logic, updating class methods, or adjusting how components interact.",
    "Ensure that the implemented changes directly address the findings from the analysis and enable the successful execution of the '1st_runner_test' plan using the existing test setup.",
    "Maintain consistency with the existing Python codebase style, structure, and best practices.",
    "Avoid making any changes to the '1st_runner_test' plan files located in `tests/1st_runner_test/current_test_plan`."
