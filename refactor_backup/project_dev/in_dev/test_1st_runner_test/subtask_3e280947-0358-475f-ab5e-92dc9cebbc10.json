  "instructions": [
    "Navigate to the `tests/integration/` directory and examine the contents of `test_ai_tool_usage.py` to identify any test cases that specifically involve running or interacting with the '1st_runner_test' plan.",
    "Navigate to the `tests/runner_tests/first_full_test/` directory and examine the contents of the Python test files within (e.g., `test_*.py`) to identify how the 'first_full_test' plan, which is the '1st_runner_test', is executed.",
    "For each identified test case or file running the '1st_runner_test' plan, document the following:",
    "- The specific test function or script that initiates the plan execution.",
    "- The method used to execute the plan (e.g., direct function call, command line execution via `subprocess`).",
    "- The criteria used to determine the success or failure of the test (e.g., checking output files, verifying console output, asserting return codes).",
    "- Any observed issues, limitations, or areas where the testing coverage for the '1st_runner_test' plan appears to be lacking.",
    "Compile all the findings into a markdown document named `docs/runner_test_analysis.md`.",
    "Ensure the `docs/runner_test_analysis.md` document clearly outlines which tests run the '1st_runner_test', how they run it, what they check, and any identified gaps or issues."
