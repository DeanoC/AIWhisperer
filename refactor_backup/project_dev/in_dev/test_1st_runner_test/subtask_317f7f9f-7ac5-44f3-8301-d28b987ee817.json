    "Navigate to the root directory of the AIWhisperer project.",

    "Monitor the test execution to ensure all assertions pass without errors.",
    "Review the test output to explicitly confirm that the process simulates a command-line execution of the '1st_runner_test' plan and that the simulated execution completed successfully."
