  "instructions": [
    "Create a new test file `tests/integration/test_interactive_session.py`.",
    "Inside `tests/integration/test_interactive_session.py`, define test functions using `pytest`.",
    "Implement a test function that simulates the start of an interactive session.",
    "Within this test, simulate the completion of a short AI task. This simulation should *not* involve actual AI service calls. You might achieve this by mocking or by using a simplified internal process.",
    "Assert that after the simulated AI task completes, the interactive session state (or a relevant indicator) remains active, indicating the application did not exit.",
    "Implement a separate test function that simulates the start of an interactive session.",
    "Within this second test, simulate the application receiving an explicit quit command or signal.",
    "Assert that upon receiving the quit command/signal, the application exits gracefully.",
    "Ensure these tests are structured to pass compilation and execution but fail the intended functionality (extending session duration after AI task completion) because the actual logic for this feature is not yet implemented.",
    "Refer to `docs/interactive_session_duration_analysis.md` for details on the expected behavior."

  "constraints": [
    "Tests must be written using the `pytest` framework.",
    "Tests should simulate AI task completion without making actual calls to external AI services.",
    "The tests should be designed to fail when run against the current codebase, as the session duration extension feature is not yet implemented."

  "validation_criteria": [
    "The file `tests/integration/test_interactive_session.py` must be created.",
    "The file `tests/integration/test_interactive_session.py` must contain at least two test functions.",
    "One test function must verify session persistence after a simulated AI task.",
    "Another test function must verify graceful exit upon receiving a quit command.",
    "Running `pytest tests/integration/test_interactive_session.py` should execute the tests.",
    "The tests should initially fail, indicating they correctly target the unimplemented feature."
