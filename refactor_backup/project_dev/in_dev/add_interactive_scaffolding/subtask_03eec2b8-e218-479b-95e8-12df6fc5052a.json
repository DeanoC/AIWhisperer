    "Analyze the current structure of `ai_whisperer/main.py` and `ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py` to understand how the main process and AI tasks are currently handled.",
    "Identify the main loop in `ai_whisperer/main.py` that manages the interactive session.",
    "Refactor the AI task execution within `ai_whisperer/ai_loop.py` or `ai_whisperer/main.py` to run in a separate thread or process.",
    "Implement a mechanism (e.g., a flag, a queue, or inter-thread communication) to signal the completion of the AI task back to the main interactive loop.",
    "Modify the main interactive loop in `ai_whisperer/main.py` to continue running and accepting user input after the AI task completion signal is received.",
    "Ensure that the main process does not exit prematurely while waiting for user input in interactive mode.",
    "Review the tests in `tests/integration/test_interactive_session.py` and execute them to verify the implemented logic.",
    "Debug and fix any issues identified during test execution.",
    "Examine existing codebase for components related to process/thread management, such as `ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py` or any threading/multiprocessing imports, to potentially reuse or integrate with existing patterns."
