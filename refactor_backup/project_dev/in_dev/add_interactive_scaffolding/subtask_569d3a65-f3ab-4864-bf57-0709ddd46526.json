  "instructions": [
    "Analyze the existing codebase, particularly `monitor/interactive_delegate.py` and `ai_whisperer/main.py`, for any existing signal handling or cleanup routines that can be leveraged or need to be integrated with.",
    "Modify or create a Textual App implementation within `monitor/interactive_delegate.py` or a new dedicated file to capture Double Ctrl-C signals.",
    "Implement a signal handler for `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C) that detects the Double Ctrl-C sequence.",
    "Within the Double Ctrl-C signal handler, trigger the graceful exit process.",
    "Implement the necessary cleanup logic within the graceful exit process. This includes:",
    "- Stopping any running threads or asynchronous tasks initiated by the interactive session.",
    "- Restoring the original ANSI delegate to ensure normal terminal behavior after exiting.",
    "- Releasing any resources held by the interactive session.",
    "Modify `ai_whisperer/main.py` to correctly manage the lifecycle of the interactive session.",
    "Ensure `ai_whisperer/main.py` initiates the interactive session with the new Textual App implementation.",
    "Ensure `ai_whisperer/main.py` correctly handles the graceful exit signal from the Textual App and performs any necessary top-level cleanup.",
    "Run the integration tests located in `tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py`.",
    "Debug and fix any issues identified by the tests until all tests pass."

  "constraints": [
    "The application must exit cleanly when Double Ctrl-C is pressed during an interactive session.",
    "The original terminal delegate (likely the ANSI delegate) must be restored immediately upon exiting the interactive session.",
    "All background threads or asynchronous operations initiated by the interactive session must be properly shut down.",
    "All tests defined in `tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py` must pass successfully after the implementation."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Manually run the application in interactive mode and verify that pressing Ctrl-C twice exits the application cleanly.",
    "After exiting interactive mode using Double Ctrl-C, verify that the terminal behaves normally (e.g., standard command line input is available).",
    "Execute the test suite (`pytest tests/integration/test_graceful_exit.py`) and confirm that all tests pass."
