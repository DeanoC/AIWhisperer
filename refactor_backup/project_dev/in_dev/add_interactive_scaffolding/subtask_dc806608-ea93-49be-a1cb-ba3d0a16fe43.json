  "instructions": [
    "Review the requirement to add an interactive prompt for the list-models feature, specifically focusing on how a user would filter or query the displayed model list.",
    "Examine the current implementation of the `list-models` feature in `ai_whisperer/cli.py` and `ai_whisperer/model_info_provider.py` to understand how models are retrieved and displayed.",
    "Identify the appropriate point within the `list-models` command's execution flow in `ai_whisperer/cli.py` where an interactive prompt can be introduced after the initial list is shown.",
    "Plan how to capture user input using Textual's input widgets or similar mechanisms within the Textual UI application. Consider how this input will be associated with the list-models context.",
    "Determine the mechanism for sending the user's query (entered in the Textual UI) to the AI service via the delegate system. This likely involves routing the user input through the `delegate_manager.py` and potentially creating a new delegate or modifying an existing one.",
    "Plan how to receive and process the AI's response (e.g., a filtered list, a summary, or an answer to a question about the models) and display it effectively within the Textual UI, updating the existing list or showing a new section.",
    "Document the analysis of the current feature, the proposed interaction flow (user input -> Textual UI -> Delegate -> AI Service -> Delegate -> Textual UI display), and the plan for implementing this interaction in `docs/list_models_interaction_analysis.md`."
