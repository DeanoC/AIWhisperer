    "Plan the implementation strategy for intercepting the signal within the AIWhisperer Textual application.",
    "Identify the necessary cleanup steps required before the application exits, including restoring the original terminal delegate (currently managed by `delegate_manager.py`) and stopping any background threads or processes.",
    "Document the findings from the analysis, the chosen signal interception strategy, and the detailed cleanup steps in the file `docs/graceful_exit_analysis.md`."
