  "instructions": [
    "Open `ai_whisperer/cli_commands.py`.",
    "Locate the `list_models` command handler function.",
    "Modify the function to instantiate and use the new refactored AI loop (`ai_whisperer/refactored_ai_loop.py`) instead of the old AI loop or direct API calls for fetching models.",
    "Ensure the refactored AI loop is configured correctly for the 'list-models' operation.",
    "Open `monitor/interactive_list_models_ui.py`.",
    "Adapt the interactive UI logic within `interactive_list_models_ui.py` to receive and process updates from the refactored AI loop. This may involve changing how the UI interacts with the loop's methods or delegates.",
    "Identify the appropriate points in the refactored AI loop execution for the 'list-models' task where user-facing updates (e.g., 'Fetching models...', 'Processing results...') should be sent.",
    "Implement delegate calls from the refactored AI loop (or its components used for list-models) to the user message delegate (`monitor/user_message_delegate.py`) to provide real-time feedback to the user during the model listing process.",
    "Ensure that the interactive UI (`monitor/interactive_list_models_ui.py`) is correctly registered as a listener or receives these delegate calls and updates its display accordingly.",
    "Test the `list-models` command from the CLI to verify it executes without errors and uses the new loop.",
    "Observe the interactive UI during the `list-models` execution to confirm that updates are displayed correctly via delegate calls."
