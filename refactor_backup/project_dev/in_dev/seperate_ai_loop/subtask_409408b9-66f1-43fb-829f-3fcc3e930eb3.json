  "instructions": [
    "Navigate to the `tests/unit` directory.",
    "Create a new Python file named `test_refactored_ai_loop.py`.",
    "Import necessary modules for testing (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest.mock`).",
    "Read and understand the design document `docs/refactored_ai_loop_design.md` to identify key functionalities and interfaces of the refactored AI loop.",
    "Write unit test functions within `test_refactored_ai_loop.py`.",
    "For each test function, use `unittest.mock` or similar techniques to mock or stub dependencies like `ExecutionEngine` and `StateManager` to isolate the AI loop logic.",
    "Write tests that specifically verify:",
    "- The handling of different input types and formats.",
    "- The correct flow of logic based on the design.",
    "- The interaction with mocked dependencies (e.g., ensuring methods on mocks are called with expected arguments).",
    "- Tests for interactive session handling, including how the AI loop processes and responds to user inputs in an interactive context.",
    "- Tests for mocked streaming scenarios, simulating the AI loop's behavior when receiving streamed responses from an AI service.",
    "- Edge cases and error handling as described in the design.",
    "Ensure the tests cover the new interfaces introduced in the refactoring.",
    "Run the tests using `pytest` or a similar test runner.",
    "Verify that the tests fail, as the implementation of the refactored AI loop is not yet complete."

    "The file `tests/unit/test_refactored_ai_loop.py` contains multiple test functions (e.g., functions prefixed with `test_`).",
    "The test cases demonstrate coverage of the core functionalities, interfaces, interactive session handling, and mocked streaming scenarios described in `docs/refactored_ai_loop_design.md`.",
    "The tests utilize mocking or stubbing for external dependencies.",
    "Running the tests using `pytest` results in test failures, indicating that the tests are correctly written but the corresponding code is not yet implemented."
