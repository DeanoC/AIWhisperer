    "Identify how a new member variable in `ANSIConsoleUserMessageHandler` would be used to store the detail level.",
    "Determine the necessary set and get methods for this new detail level member variable.",
    "Plan the modifications needed within the `display_message` method to conditionally display information based on the stored detail level.",
    "Analyze the existing CLI parsing logic in `src/ai_whisperer/cli.py` to understand how command-line arguments are handled.",
    "Determine the best way to add a new optional argument for specifying the detail level (e.g., `--detail level`).",
    "Outline the required changes to the CLI parser to correctly parse this new option and pass the value to the relevant parts of the application.",
    "Synthesize the findings from the analysis of `ANSIConsoleUserMessageHandler` and the CLI parser.",
    "Outline the high-level implementation steps, including the order of code changes.",
    "Detail the specific code changes required in both `src/ai_whisperer/basic_output_display_message.py` and `src/ai_whisperer/cli.py`.",
    "Document the complete plan, including the identified changes and implementation steps, in a new markdown file located at `docs/detail_option_implementation_plan.md`."
