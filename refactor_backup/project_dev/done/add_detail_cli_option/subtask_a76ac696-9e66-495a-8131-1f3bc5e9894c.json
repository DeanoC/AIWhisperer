  "instructions": [
    "Open and carefully read the code in `ai_whisperer/ansi_console_user_message_handler.py`.",
    "Identify the class(es) and method(s) responsible for displaying messages to the console.",
    "Analyze how message content and formatting are currently handled.",
    "Determine potential insertion points or modifications needed to incorporate logic for different detail levels (e.g., 'minimal', 'standard', 'verbose').",
    "Open and carefully read the code in `ai_whisperer/cli.py`.",
    "Identify the code responsible for parsing command-line arguments, likely using a library like `argparse`.",
    "Determine where to add a new command-line option (e.g., `--detail`) to specify the desired detail level.",
    "Consider how the value of this new option will be accessed and passed to other parts of the application, specifically the message handling logic.",
    "Based on the analysis of both files, create a new Markdown file named `docs/detail_option_implementation_plan.md`.",
    "In `docs/detail_option_implementation_plan.md`, document the findings from the code analysis.",
    "Specifically, list the identified classes and methods in `ai_whisperer/ansi_console_user_message_handler.py` and `ai_whisperer/cli.py` that will require modification.",
    "Outline a high-level plan for implementing the detail level option, describing how the CLI argument will be parsed and how the detail level will influence message display in the console handler."
