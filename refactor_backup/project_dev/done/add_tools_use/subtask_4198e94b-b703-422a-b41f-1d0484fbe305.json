  "instructions": [
    "Review the existing tool interface design (`docs/tool_interface_design.md`) to understand how individual tools are defined and interact.",
    "Design the core mechanism for discovering or registering tools within the system. Consider approaches like file-based discovery, configuration-based registration, or dynamic loading.",
    "Detail the design for retrieving a list of all available tools. Specify the data structure and content of the list.",
    "Design the filtering mechanism for tools. Define how filtering criteria will be specified and processed. Consider common filtering needs (e.g., by type, capability, tags).",
    "Design the process for selecting a specific tool by its unique identifier (e.g., name or ID). Include how the system will handle cases where the requested tool does not exist.",
    "Document the design in `docs/tool_management_design.md`, including diagrams or pseudocode where helpful."
