  "instructions": [
    "Locate and examine the code files within the `src/ai_whisperer/` directory that are responsible for path management, specifically `path_management.py`, and how paths are provided to the runner.",
    "Examine the code files related to the runner, likely within `src/ai_whisperer/`, to understand how it receives and uses different types of paths (e.g., workspace, output). Identify the specific functions or classes involved in path handling.",
    "Analyze the codebase to determine if any existing mechanisms or logic are in place to restrict the runner's access to specific directories or enforce path boundaries.",
    "Based on the analysis, identify the specific code files and potentially functions/methods within `src/ai_whisperer/` that will require modification to implement directory restriction for the runner.",
    "Document the findings of the analysis in `docs/path_manager_analysis.md`, including a description of current path usage, how the runner handles paths, existing restrictions (if any), and a list of the identified code files for modification."
