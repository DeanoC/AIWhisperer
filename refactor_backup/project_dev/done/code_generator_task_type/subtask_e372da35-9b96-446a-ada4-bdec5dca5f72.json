  "description": "Create integration tests to verify the `code_generation` handler works correctly within the execution engine.",
  "instructions": [
    "Navigate to the `tests/integration` directory.",
    "Create a new Python file named `test_code_generation_handler_integration.py`.",
    "Import necessary modules from `pytest`, the execution engine (`ai_whisperer.execution_engine`), the code generation handler (`ai_whisperer.agent_handlers.code_generation`), and any required mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`).",
    "Define a test class, for example, `TestCodeGenerationHandlerIntegration`.",
    "Within the test class, define test methods using `pytest` fixtures and mocking.",
    "Create dummy implementations or mock objects for external dependencies, specifically the AI service, to return predictable responses for code generation requests.",
    "Create dummy implementations or mock objects for any tools that the `code_generation` handler might interact with (e.g., file writing tools) to simulate their behavior without actual file system interaction.",
    "Write a test method (`test_generate_new_file`) that constructs a simple plan containing a `code_generation` task intended to create a new file. Configure the mocked AI service to return a response that includes the file path and content. Execute this plan using the execution engine and verify that the mocked file writing tool was called with the expected arguments.",
    "Write a test method (`test_modify_existing_file`) that constructs a simple plan containing a `code_generation` task intended to modify an existing file. Configure the mocked AI service to return a response that includes the file path and modified content. Execute this plan and verify the mocked file writing tool received the correct update.",
    "Write a test method (`test_code_generation_with_test_execution`) that constructs a plan including a `code_generation` task followed by a task that simulates test execution. Configure the mocked AI service to return code and a mocked test runner to return a predictable success or failure result. Verify the execution engine processes the subsequent task based on the mocked test result.",
    "Write test methods to handle edge cases, such as the mocked AI service returning malformed JSON or the mocked test runner indicating test failures. Verify the execution engine's behavior in these scenarios (e.g., logging errors, marking the task as failed).",
    "Ensure the tests primarily focus on the flow and interaction between the execution engine, the `code_generation` handler, and the mocked dependencies, rather than the internal logic of the handler itself (which should be covered by unit tests).",
    "Add necessary `pytest` markers or fixtures for setup and teardown if required.",
    "Run the tests to confirm they are syntactically correct and execute without errors, expecting them to fail initially due to the nature of testing error handling and incomplete scenarios."

    "Running `pytest tests/integration/test_code_generation_handler_integration.py` executes the tests without syntax errors.",
    "The tests are expected to fail initially as they verify various scenarios, including potential error paths."
