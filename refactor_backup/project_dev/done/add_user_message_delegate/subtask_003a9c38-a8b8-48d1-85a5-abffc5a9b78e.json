  "description": "Update documentation to reflect the new user message delegate system.",
  "instructions": [
    "Locate the primary documentation file for user message handling or overall system architecture. Based on the workspace context, `docs/user_message_analysis.md` seems like a relevant starting point, but also consider `docs/index.md` or other relevant files.",
    "Update the identified documentation file(s) to include a new section or integrate information about the `user_message_delegate.py`.",
    "Clearly explain the purpose of the user message delegate and how it is used within the system.",
    "Detail the different message levels supported by the delegate (e.g., info, warning, error) and when each should be used.",
    "Provide guidance on how a developer could potentially add new output classes or extend the delegate's functionality in the future.",
    "Review the `src/user_message_delegate.py` and `src/basic_output_test.py` files to ensure that all functions, classes, and methods have clear and accurate docstrings.",
    "Add or update docstrings as necessary in the relevant code files.",
    "Ensure the documentation is consistent with the implementation in `src/user_message_delegate.py`."

    "Documentation updates must be clear and easy to understand.",
    "Docstrings must follow the project's established style guide (if any, otherwise use standard Python docstring conventions).",

    "The documentation file(s) (`docs/user_message_analysis.md`, `docs/index.md`, or others identified) contain information about the user message delegate.",

    "The documentation includes guidance on extending the delegate.",
    "Docstrings in `src/user_message_delegate.py` and `src/basic_output_test.py` are present and accurately describe the code.",
