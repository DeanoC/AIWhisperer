    "Identify the essential functions and capabilities the user message delegate must provide.",
    "Determine the specific data inputs the delegate will receive (e.g., the message content, the severity level of the message).",
    "Identify the expected output format and destination for the user messages. Based on the input, this is expected to be ANSI colored console output.",
    "Based on the identified requirements, outline a high-level structure for the user message delegate class.",
    "Outline the basic structure for a test class specifically designed to verify the output of the user message delegate, ensuring it handles different message levels and produces the correct ANSI colored output.",
    "Document the analysis findings, including the identified core functionality, input/output specifications, and the proposed basic structures for the delegate and test classes, in a new Markdown file located at `docs/user_message_analysis.md`."
