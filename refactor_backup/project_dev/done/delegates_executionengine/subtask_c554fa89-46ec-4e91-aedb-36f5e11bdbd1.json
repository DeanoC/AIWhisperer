  "instructions": [
    "Navigate to the `docs` directory in the workspace.",
    "Create a new markdown file named `delegate_system.md` if it doesn't exist, or open it for editing.",
    "Write comprehensive documentation explaining the new delegate and observer system.",
    "Include sections on:",
    "- What delegates and observers are in the context of AIWhisperer.",
    "- How to register observers for the execution engine and AI loop.",
    "- What types of events can be observed from the execution engine (e.g., task start, subtask complete, command execution).",
    "- What types of events can be observed from the AI loop (e.g., AI call start, AI response received).",
    "- How to use delegates to control the execution flow (e.g., pausing, resuming, stopping tasks or subtasks).",
    "- The benefits of using the delegate/observer system for monitoring, debugging, and custom workflows.",
    "Provide clear and concise code examples demonstrating:",
    "- Registering a simple observer for execution engine events.",
    "- Registering a simple observer for AI loop events.",
    "- Using a delegate to pause and resume execution based on a condition.",
    "Ensure the code examples are accurate and runnable within the AIWhisperer environment.",
    "Open the `README.md` file in the root of the workspace.",
    "Locate the section discussing features or capabilities.",
    "Add a new point or update an existing one to mention the new monitoring, debugging, and control capabilities provided by the delegate and observer system.",
    "Briefly explain how this system allows users or developers to gain deeper insight into and control over the AI execution process.",
    "Review both `docs/delegate_system.md` and `README.md` to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency."

  "constraints": [
    "Documentation must be clear, concise, and easy for both users and developers to understand.",
    "Code examples must be accurate, runnable, and demonstrate practical use cases.",
    "The documentation should be formatted using standard Markdown.",
    "The updates to `README.md` should be brief and highlight the new capabilities without going into excessive detail (referencing `delegate_system.md` for more information is appropriate)."

    "The file `docs/delegate_system.md` exists.",
    "`docs/delegate_system.md` contains sections explaining delegates, observers, registration, event types for both execution engine and AI loop, and control mechanisms.",
    "`docs/delegate_system.md` includes at least one code example for observer registration (execution engine or AI loop) and at least one code example for using a delegate for control.",
    "The code examples in `docs/delegate_system.md` are syntactically correct and appear logically sound.",
    "The file `README.md` in the root directory has been modified.",
    "`README.md` includes a reference to the new delegate/observer system and its benefits (monitoring, debugging, control).",
    "The documentation in `docs/delegate_system.md` accurately reflects the implemented delegate and observer system.",
    "The overall documentation is well-organized and easy to navigate."
