    "Open `src/ai_whisperer/ai_service_interaction.py` and `project_dev/rfc/store_cost_tokens_to_ai_calls.md` to understand the current architecture and proposed changes.",

    "Specifically examine how exceptions and results are handled after an API call.",
    "Consult the OpenRouter API documentation to determine the structure of the response object that contains cost and token information (e.g., input tokens, output tokens, and cost). Identify the specific JSON keys for these values.",
    "Map the identified OpenRouter API response fields to the current response processing in `src/ai_whisperer/ai_service_interaction.py` to understand where this data could be extracted.",
    "Write the findings in `docs/cost_token_analysis_summary.md`, including the identified API response fields and a proposed strategy for capturing and storing this information during the AI call processing."
