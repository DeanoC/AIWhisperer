# Async Agents Phase 4: State Persistence - TDD Logbook

## Overview
Implementing state persistence for async agents using Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

**Goal**: Agents can persist their state across server restarts, maintain context, and resume work seamlessly.

## TDD Approach
- **RED**: Write failing tests first
- **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass tests  
- **REFACTOR**: Clean up and optimize while keeping tests green

---

## Phase 4 Requirements Analysis

### Core State Persistence Needs
1. **Agent Session State**: Active agents, their configurations, current status
2. **Task Queue State**: Pending tasks, in-progress work, completed items
3. **Context State**: Conversation history, working memory, agent-specific data
4. **Sleep State**: Which agents are sleeping, wake conditions, sleep start times
5. **Mail State**: Unread messages, mail history, pending replies

### Technical Architecture
- **Storage Backend**: File-based JSON initially (can extend to database later)
- **Persistence Trigger**: On state changes, periodic saves, graceful shutdown
- **Recovery Process**: Load state on startup, validate integrity, resume operations
- **State Validation**: Ensure loaded state is consistent and valid

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Agents maintain state across server restarts
- [ ] Task queues are preserved and resumed
- [ ] Sleep/wake states are restored correctly  
- [ ] Mail history and unread messages persist
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] State corruption is handled gracefully

## TDD Cycle 1: Basic Agent State Persistence

### ðŸ”´ RED Phase (Write Failing Tests)

**Target**: Test that agent sessions can be saved and restored

#### Test Plan
1. Create agent session with known state
2. Save state to persistence layer
3. Simulate server restart (clear memory)
4. Load state from persistence layer
5. Verify agent session matches original state

**Test File**: `tests/unit/test_agent_state_persistence.py`

#### Key Test Cases
- `test_save_agent_session_state()` - Save basic agent state
- `test_load_agent_session_state()` - Load and verify agent state
- `test_agent_state_roundtrip()` - Save â†’ Load â†’ Verify complete cycle
- `test_invalid_state_handling()` - Handle corrupted/invalid state files
- `test_state_file_not_found()` - Handle missing state files gracefully

## Implementation Log

### Session Start: 2025-06-06

#### 13:30 - Phase 4 Kickoff
- âœ… Created detailed TDD logbook
- âœ… Analyzed requirements for state persistence
- âœ… Starting with basic agent state persistence tests
- **Next**: Write failing tests for agent session state management

#### 13:45 - RED Phase Complete âœ…
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite: `tests/unit/test_agent_state_persistence.py`
- âœ… 13 test cases covering all major persistence scenarios:
  - Basic save/load operations
  - Task queue persistence
  - Sleep state management
  - Error handling (corrupted files, permissions, missing files)
  - Async operations
  - State cleanup
- âœ… All tests correctly skip due to missing implementation
- âœ… Test structure follows TDD best practices
- **Next**: Implement minimal StatePersistenceManager (GREEN phase)

#### 14:00 - GREEN Phase Complete âœ…
- âœ… Implemented `StatePersistenceManager` class in `state_persistence.py`
- âœ… All 13 tests now passing with minimal implementation
- âœ… Key features implemented:
  - Agent session state save/load with JSON files
  - Task queue state persistence
  - Sleep state management
  - Async versions of save/load operations
  - Error handling for corrupted/missing files
  - State cleanup with configurable age limits
  - Atomic writes with temp files for safety
  - Metadata injection (`_saved_at`, `_session_id`) for audit trails
- âœ… File structure follows planned design: `state/{agents,tasks,sleep,system}/`
- âœ… Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Next**: Refactor for clean design and integration (REFACTOR phase)

#### 14:15 - REFACTOR Phase Complete âœ…
- âœ… Added clean architecture components:
  - `StateSerializer` protocol with `JSONStateSerializer` implementation
  - `StateValidator` class with validation for all state types
  - `StateMetadata` dataclass for structured metadata
- âœ… Enhanced StatePersistenceManager with:
  - Dependency injection for serializer and validator
  - Thread-safe file operations with per-file locking
  - Atomic writes with proper error handling and cleanup
  - Comprehensive validation on save and load operations
  - Better separation of concerns with helper methods
- âœ… All 13 tests still passing after refactoring
- âœ… Code is now more maintainable, testable, and extensible
- **Next**: Integrate with AsyncAgentSessionManager for real-world usage

#### 14:30 - Integration Complete âœ…
- âœ… Integrated StatePersistenceManager into AsyncAgentSessionManager
- âœ… Added comprehensive state persistence methods:
  - `save_session_state(agent_id)` - Save individual agent state
  - `save_all_session_states()` - Save all active agents
  - `restore_session_state(agent_id)` - Restore individual agent
  - `restore_all_session_states()` - Restore all persisted agents
  - `cleanup_old_states(max_age_hours)` - Clean up old state files
- âœ… State serialization includes:
  - Agent configuration and metadata
  - Task queue state (pending, in-progress, completed)
  - Sleep state (duration, wake events, sleep time)
  - Conversation context and working memory
  - Error counts and custom metadata
- âœ… Created and passed integration test verifying real-world functionality
- âœ… State persistence is thread-safe and atomic

## Architecture Decisions

### State Storage Format
**Decision**: JSON files in `state/` directory
**Rationale**: Simple, readable, version-controllable, easy debugging
**Alternatives Considered**: SQLite, Redis, Binary formats

### State Organization
```
state/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/           # Individual agent session states
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ alice_session_123.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ debbie_session_456.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ patricia_session_789.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/            # Task queue states per agent
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ alice_tasks_123.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ debbie_tasks_456.json  
â”œâ”€â”€ mail/             # Mail system state
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mailboxes.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mail_history.json
â””â”€â”€ system/           # Global system state
    â”œâ”€â”€ active_sessions.json
    â””â”€â”€ metadata.json
```

### State Update Strategy
**Decision**: Write-through caching with immediate persistence
**Rationale**: Ensures consistency, minimizes data loss on crashes
**Trade-offs**: Slightly higher I/O overhead vs guaranteed persistence

---

## Code Quality Standards

### Test Requirements
- All new code must have tests written first (TDD)
- Minimum 90% test coverage for persistence layer
- Tests must be fast (<1s each) and isolated
- Integration tests for full save/restore cycles

### Code Style
- Follow existing codebase patterns
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Clear separation of concerns
- Async/await for I/O operations

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **File I/O Performance**: Large state files may slow down operations
   - *Mitigation*: Incremental saves, compression, async I/O
2. **State Corruption**: Power loss during write operations
   - *Mitigation*: Atomic writes, backup files, integrity checks
3. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple processes accessing state files
   - *Mitigation*: File locking, process coordination

### Operational Risks  
1. **Disk Space**: State files growing too large
   - *Mitigation*: State cleanup, archival, size monitoring
2. **State Drift**: In-memory state diverging from persisted state
   - *Mitigation*: Regular validation, reconciliation processes
