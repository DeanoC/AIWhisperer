# Alice Prompt Cleanup Logbook

## Objective
Review Alice's prompt for any unnecessary verbose instructions, particularly around mail processing, following the same approach used for Debbie.

## Initial Assessment
Alice's prompt is already quite clean:
- No verbose mail processing protocol sections
- Only contains useful documentation about `send_mail_with_switch` usage
- Follows the minimal prompt pattern

## Test Process
1. Create test for Alice's mail sending capability
2. Run baseline test with current prompt
3. Evaluate if any changes are needed

## Test Files
- `test_alice_mail_send.txt`: Test Alice sending mail to Debbie

## Test Results

### Test 1: Baseline Mail Sending
- **Date**: 2025-06-06 04:59:28
- **Prompt Version**: Current 
- **Test**: Alice sends mail to Debbie asking for calculation
- **Expected**: Alice successfully sends mail and receives response
- **Result**: âœ… PASSED - Alice sent mail, Debbie responded "The answer to 'What is 10 + 10?' is 20."

## Findings
1. **Alice's prompt is already clean and minimal** - No verbose mail processing instructions present
2. **The Agent Communication section is useful documentation** - It explains how to use `send_mail_with_switch` with examples
3. **Mail sending works perfectly** - The synchronous communication pattern functions as designed

## Recommendations
1. **No changes needed to Alice's prompt** - It's already following best practices
2. **Keep the Agent Communication section** - It provides helpful usage examples without being verbose
3. **Alice's prompt can serve as a template** - It shows the right balance of minimal instructions with useful documentation

## Conclusion
Alice's prompt demonstrates the ideal pattern:
- Minimal core instructions
- Useful documentation for specific features (like `send_mail_with_switch`)
- No workaround instructions or verbose protocols
- Relies on system prompts (core.md, mailbox_protocol.md) for standard behavior
