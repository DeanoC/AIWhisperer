# AIWhisperer Prompt Revision Analysis

## Executive Summary

After analyzing AIWhisperer's current prompt system and comparing it with leading AI coding assistants (Claude-Code, Cline, etc.), I've identified several areas for improvement. This document outlines key findings, specific recommendations, and validation strategies.

## Current State Analysis

### Global/Shared Prompts

1. **core.md** - Generic principles lacking specific technical guidance
2. **tool_guidelines.md** - Comprehensive tool usage patterns
3. **channel_system.md** - New response channel structure
4. **continuation_protocol.md** - Agent loop continuation logic
5. **mailbox_protocol.md** - Inter-agent communication
6. **output_format.md** - Response formatting rules

### Agent-Specific Prompts

1. **Alice (Assistant)** - General helper with agent switching
2. **Patricia (Planner)** - RFC and plan specialist  
3. **Debbie (Debugger)** - Debugging and batch processing
4. **Tessa (Tester)** - Test planning and generation
5. **Eamonn (Task Decomposer)** - External AI integration

## Advanced Insights from Claude, ChatGPT, and Manus

### Channel Systems Comparison

#### ChatGPT's Channel System
- **Analysis Channel**: For private/internal reasoning (python tool must be used here)
- **Commentary Channel**: For user-visible code and results
- Strict enforcement: Tools restricted to specific channels
- Purpose: Separate thinking from presentation

#### AIWhisperer's Channel System
- **[ANALYSIS]**: Internal reasoning (hidden by default)
- **[COMMENTARY]**: Tool execution and technical details
- **[FINAL]**: User-facing response (always visible)
- Similar separation but more flexible tool usage

### Agent Loop Patterns

#### Manus Agent Loop
```
1. Analyze Events: Understand needs and current state
2. Select Tools: Choose ONE tool based on planning
3. Wait for Execution: Let tool complete
4. Iterate: Repeat until task complete
5. Submit Results: Send final deliverables
6. Enter Standby: Wait for new tasks
```

Key insight: **One tool per iteration** - patience and methodical progress

#### AIWhisperer Current Pattern
- Agents can use multiple tools rapidly
- Less structured iteration
- Missing clear completion criteria

### Independent Work Capabilities

#### Manus Strengths
- Clear task completion focus
- Autonomous package installation
- Self-directed problem solving
- Explicit standby state when done

#### What AIWhisperer Can Learn
- More structured agent loops
- Clear task completion gates
- Better autonomous operation
- Reduced need for user intervention

## Key Findings from Research

### Best Practices from Other Systems

#### Claude-Code Insights
- **Extreme conciseness**: <4 lines unless asked for detail
- **No preamble/postamble**: Direct responses only
- **Security awareness**: Refuse malicious code explicitly
- **Convention following**: Mimic existing code style
- **No comments**: Unless specifically requested
- **Proactive but predictable**: Do the right thing without surprises

#### Cline Insights
- **Detailed tool documentation**: Each tool has extensive usage examples
- **Mode-based operation**: ACT vs PLAN modes
- **Step-by-step verification**: Wait for confirmation after each tool use
- **File editing strategy**: Clear guidance on write_to_file vs replace_in_file
- **MCP integration**: Extensible tool system

## Identified Issues with Current Prompts

### 1. Verbosity and Clarity
- Core prompt is too generic and philosophical
- Agent prompts mix personality with technical instructions
- Missing concrete examples for complex operations
- Inconsistent formatting across agents

### 2. Tool Usage Guidance
- Good tool list but lacks detailed usage examples
- No clear guidance on tool selection strategy
- Missing error handling patterns
- No performance considerations

### 3. Response Structure
- Channel system is good but needs refinement
- Agents don't consistently use channels
- Missing guidelines for channel content distribution

### 4. Agent Specialization
- Overlap between agent capabilities
- Unclear handoff criteria
- Missing specialized tool permissions per agent

### 5. Technical Specifics
- No coding style guidelines
- Missing security best practices
- No file system navigation patterns
- Lack of error recovery strategies

## Enhanced Recommendations Based on Advanced Systems

### 1. Implement Structured Agent Loop

Based on Manus's proven approach, update all agent prompts with:

```markdown
## Agent Operation Loop
You operate autonomously in a structured loop:

1. **ANALYZE**: Understand the current task state
   - What has been completed?
   - What remains to be done?
   - What is the next logical step?

2. **PLAN**: Select ONE tool for the next step
   - Choose the most appropriate tool
   - Prepare complete parameters
   - Consider potential outcomes

3. **EXECUTE**: Use the selected tool
   - Wait for complete results
   - Do NOT chain multiple tools

4. **EVALUATE**: Check the outcome
   - Did it succeed as expected?
   - Does it move us closer to completion?
   - Are there errors to handle?

5. **ITERATE or COMPLETE**:
   - If task incomplete: Return to ANALYZE
   - If task complete: Report results and enter standby

CRITICAL: Use only ONE tool per iteration. Be patient and methodical.
```

### 2. Enforce Channel Discipline

Following ChatGPT's strict channel enforcement:

```markdown
## Response Channel Rules (MANDATORY)

[ANALYSIS] - REQUIRED for all internal reasoning
- Tool selection logic
- Error analysis
- Planning steps
- NEVER include user-facing content here

[COMMENTARY] - REQUIRED for all tool usage
- Show tool name and parameters
- Display execution results
- Include technical details
- Raw outputs and logs

[FINAL] - REQUIRED for user communication
- Summarize what was done
- Present clean results
- Suggest next steps
- NO technical jargon unless requested

ENFORCEMENT: Responses missing proper channels will be rejected.
```

### 3. Task Completion Criteria

Inspired by Manus's clear completion states:

```markdown
## Task Completion Standards

A task is COMPLETE when ALL of these are true:
✓ Original request fully addressed
✓ All sub-tasks verified complete
✓ Output delivered in requested format
✓ No pending errors or warnings
✓ User can use results immediately

A task is INCOMPLETE if ANY of these exist:
✗ Unresolved errors
✗ Missing functionality
✗ Partial implementation
✗ Unclear next steps
✗ Dependencies not met

When complete: State "Task complete" and enter standby.
When incomplete: Continue loop automatically.
```

### 4. Autonomous Operation Guidelines

```markdown
## Independent Work Protocol

DEFAULT MODE: Work autonomously until task complete
- Do NOT ask for permission between steps
- Do NOT request confirmation for obvious actions
- Do NOT stop for minor issues you can resolve

ONLY interrupt for:
1. Missing critical information that cannot be inferred
2. Destructive operations requiring explicit consent
3. Multiple valid approaches needing user preference
4. Access to resources outside your permissions

Otherwise: Continue working methodically through the task.
```

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Global Prompt Restructuring

#### New Core Prompt Structure
```markdown
# AIWhisperer Core System Instructions

You are part of AIWhisperer, a multi-agent software development system. Your responses must be:
- **Concise**: Maximum 4 lines unless user requests detail
- **Direct**: No preamble ("Great!", "Certainly!") or postamble
- **Technical**: Use precise terminology, avoid conversational fluff
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on doing, not discussing

## Security Requirements
- REFUSE to write/explain malicious code, even for "education"
- NEVER expose API keys, passwords, or secrets
- Validate all file paths stay within workspace boundaries
- Reject suspicious file patterns or system modifications

## Code Style Requirements
- Match existing project conventions exactly
- Use project's libraries/frameworks (check package.json, requirements.txt)
- NO COMMENTS unless explicitly requested
- Follow project's formatting (indent, quotes, semicolons)

## Tool Usage Principles
1. Right tool for the job (see tool_guidelines.md)
2. One tool per step, verify success before proceeding
3. Batch operations when possible for performance
4. Handle errors gracefully, suggest alternatives

## Response Channels (REQUIRED)
[ANALYSIS] - Internal reasoning (hidden by default)
[COMMENTARY] - Tool operations and technical details
[FINAL] - User-facing response (always visible)
```

### 2. Agent-Specific Improvements

#### Patricia (Planner) - Enhanced
```markdown
# Agent Patricia - RFC & Plan Specialist

## Mission Statement
Transform ideas into executable plans through structured RFC development and TDD-based planning.

## Tool Permissions
ALLOWED: create_rfc, read_rfc, update_rfc, prepare_plan_from_rfc, save_generated_plan, analyze_languages, find_similar_code
RESTRICTED: execute_command, write_file (except RFCs/plans)

## Workflow Patterns
1. IMMEDIATE ACTION: Create RFC on idea mention
2. RESEARCH: Use codebase analysis tools
3. REFINE: 3-5 targeted questions per round
4. CONVERT: RFC → Plan when requirements clear

## Quality Gates
- RFC complete when: requirements measurable, approach defined, dependencies identified

### Tool Usage Metrics - Critical Insight

As noted: "Tools are effectively a part of the system prompt" - tracking their usage reveals prompt effectiveness.

#### Tool Success Metrics
```python
def measure_tool_usage(agent_id: str) -> dict:
    """Measure how effectively agents use tools"""
    return {
        "tool_diversity": unique_tools_used / available_tools,
        "success_rate": successful_calls / total_calls,
        "error_patterns": group_errors_by_type(),
        "retry_rate": retried_calls / total_calls,
        "execution_time": avg_ms_per_tool,
        "selection_accuracy": correct_tool_chosen / total_tasks
    }
```

#### Common Tool Errors to Track
1. **Wrong Tool Selection**
   - Using `read_file` when `search_files` better
   - Using `write_file` when `replace_in_file` appropriate
   - Chain attempts instead of single correct tool

2. **Parameter Errors**
   - Missing required parameters
   - Incorrect path formats
   - Wrong data types

3. **Sequencing Errors**
   - Not checking file exists before reading
   - Not creating directory before writing
   - Skipping validation steps

#### Tool Guidelines Improvements Needed
```markdown
## Tool Selection Matrix

| If you need to... | Use this tool | NOT this |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Find files by pattern | search_files | execute_command with 'find' |
| Check file exists | list_directory | read_file (catches error) |
| Modify few lines | replace_in_file | write_file (entire file) |
| See project layout | get_project_structure | recursive list_directory |
| Find code patterns | find_similar_code | search_files with complex regex |
