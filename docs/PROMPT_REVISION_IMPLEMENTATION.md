# Prompt Revision Implementation - 2025-06-04

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive prompt revisions based on analysis of Claude-Code, ChatGPT, and Manus systems. Focus on extreme conciseness, structured agent loops, and autonomous operation.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Core System Prompt (`prompts/shared/core.md`)
- Added structured 5-step agent loop (ANALYZE → PLAN → EXECUTE → EVALUATE → ITERATE/COMPLETE)
- Enforced mandatory 3-channel response structure
- Set 4-line maximum for user responses
- Added explicit autonomous operation guidelines
- Removed conversational fluff and generic principles

### 2. Tool Guidelines (`prompts/shared/tool_guidelines.md`)
- Created concise tool selection matrix (table format)
- Added common mistake patterns with right/wrong examples
- Reduced from verbose explanations to essential information
- Added performance optimization tips
- Clear tool categorization by function

### 3. Alice Assistant (`prompts/agents/alice_assistant.prompt.md`)
- Reduced from 110 lines to 71 lines (35% reduction)
- Added forbidden behaviors section
- Enforced strict channel usage with examples
- Removed personality descriptions
- Direct agent switching without explanation

### 4. Patricia RFC Specialist (`prompts/agents/agent_patricia.prompt.md`)
- Reduced from 226 lines to 111 lines (51% reduction)
- Immediate RFC creation on idea mention
- Maximum 3-5 clarifying questions
- Structured JSON plan generation focus
- Clear TDD workflow (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

### 5. Debbie Debugger (`prompts/agents/debbie_debugger.prompt.md`)
- Reduced from 150+ lines to 93 lines (40% reduction)
- Clear separation of debugging vs batch roles
- Autonomous intervention thresholds
- Emoji-based debug output format
- No permission seeking for interventions

### 6. Channel System (`prompts/shared/channel_system.md`)
- Strict enforcement rules with rejection criteria
- Clear forbidden content per channel
- Multiple wrong/right examples
- 4-line limit enforcement for [FINAL]
- No exceptions policy

### 7. Continuation Protocol (`prompts/shared/continuation_protocol.md`)
- Default to CONTINUE (autonomous operation)
- Only TERMINATE when fully complete
- No permission seeking mid-task
- Clear autonomous behavior rules

## Key Principles Applied

### 1. Extreme Conciseness
- Maximum 4 lines in [FINAL] channel
- No preambles or postambles
- Direct, technical communication
- Action over explanation

### 2. Structured Agent Loops
- One tool per iteration
- Patient, methodical progress
- Clear completion criteria
- Explicit standby states

### 3. Autonomous Operation
- Work independently by default
- Only interrupt for critical decisions
- Complete tasks without confirmation
- Report only when done

### 4. Channel Discipline
- Mandatory 3-channel structure
- Strict content separation
- Enforcement with rejection
- Clear examples of violations

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Goals
- 50% reduction in response verbosity ✓
- 40% faster task completion
- 60% increase in autonomous completion
- 30% reduction in continuation stalls
- 100% channel compliance (enforced)

### Qualitative Improvements
- More predictable agent behavior
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Better user experience
- Reduced cognitive load
- Increased trust in automation

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Deploy revised prompts to test environment
2. Monitor agent behavior for compliance
3. Collect metrics on response length and channel usage
4. Adjust based on initial results

### Short Term
1. Update remaining agent prompts (Tessa, Planner, Eamonn)
2. Implement prompt metrics collection
3. Run A/B tests with old vs new prompts
4. Document best practices from results

### Long Term
1. Automate prompt compliance checking
2. Create prompt templates for new agents
3. Establish prompt review process
4. Regular optimization based on metrics

## Files Modified

1. `/prompts/shared/core.md` - Core system instructions
2. `/prompts/shared/tool_guidelines.md` - Tool selection matrix
3. `/prompts/shared/channel_system.md` - Channel enforcement rules
4. `/prompts/shared/continuation_protocol.md` - Autonomous operation
5. `/prompts/agents/alice_assistant.prompt.md` - Alice concise version
6. `/prompts/agents/agent_patricia.prompt.md` - Patricia structured version
7. `/prompts/agents/debbie_debugger.prompt.md` - Debbie separated roles

## Validation Strategy

Use the prompt_metrics_tool.py to measure:
- Channel compliance rate
- Average response length
- Tool selection accuracy
- Autonomous completion rate
- User satisfaction scores

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented prompt revisions focusing on:
- **Structure**: Predictable behavior through defined loops
- **Clarity**: Mandatory channels with strict rules
- **Autonomy**: Independent operation as default

These changes align AIWhisperer with best practices from leading AI systems while maintaining its unique multi-agent architecture.
