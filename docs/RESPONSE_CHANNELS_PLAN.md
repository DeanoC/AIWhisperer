# Response Channels Architecture Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a multi-channel response architecture to cleanly separate different types of AI-generated content, preventing metadata and internal reasoning from leaking into user-visible responses.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the AI response system mixes different types of content:
- Internal reasoning and analysis
- Tool calls with their raw JSON
- User-facing explanations
- Continuation metadata
- Debug information

This leads to:
- JSON metadata appearing in chat responses
- Confusing user experience
- Difficulty controlling what users see
- Mixed concerns in response handling

## Solution: Multi-Channel Architecture

### Channel Types
1. **`analysis` channel**: Private reasoning and thought process
   - Never shown to users
   - Contains AI's internal monologue
   - Debugging information
   - Decision-making process

2. **`commentary` channel**: Tool execution stream
   - Shows tool calls and their results
   - No plain text explanations
   - Structured data only
   - Can be toggled on/off by users

3. **`final` channel**: User-facing response
   - Clean, polished text
   - No tool calls or JSON
   - Human-readable explanations
   - Primary user interface

```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **Define Channel Types**
   - Create enum for channel types
   - Define channel metadata structure
   - Establish channel routing rules

2. **Message Structure Updates**
   ```python
   class ChannelMessage:
       channel: ChannelType
       content: str
       metadata: Dict[str, Any]
       timestamp: datetime
       sequence: int
   ```

3. **Channel Router**
   - Parse AI responses
   - Identify content types
   - Route to appropriate channels
   - Handle channel-specific formatting

### Phase 2: Backend Integration
1. **Modify AI Response Processing**
   - Update response parsing logic
   - Implement channel detection
   - Add channel routing

2. **WebSocket Protocol Updates**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "channel_message",
     "channel": "final|commentary|analysis",
     "content": "...",
     "metadata": {
       "sequence": 1,
       "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Channel Storage**
   - Store messages by channel
   - Maintain channel history
   - Support channel replay

### Phase 3: Frontend Support
1. **Channel Display Components**
   - Final channel: Main chat display
   - Commentary channel: Collapsible tool panel
   - Analysis channel: Debug view (dev mode only)

2. **Channel Controls**
   - Toggle commentary visibility
   - Channel filtering
   - Channel-specific styling

3. **User Preferences**
   - Save channel visibility preferences
   - Default channel settings
   - Channel notification settings

### Phase 4: AI Integration
1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Teach AI about channels
   - Channel-specific formatting rules
   - Channel switching commands

2. **Response Templates**
   ```
   [ANALYSIS]
   I need to search for files first...
   [/ANALYSIS]
   
   [COMMENTARY]
   <tool_call>search_files</tool_call>
   [/COMMENTARY]
   
   [FINAL]
   I'll search for the relevant files in your project.
   [/FINAL]
   ```

3. **Smart Channel Detection**
   - Auto-detect channel from content type
   - Fallback rules for unclear cases
   - Channel hint system

## Data Structures

### Channel Types
```python
from enum import Enum

class ChannelType(Enum):
    ANALYSIS = "analysis"
    COMMENTARY = "commentary"  
    FINAL = "final"
```

### Channel Message Format
```python
@dataclass
class ChannelMessage:
    channel: ChannelType
    content: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: datetime
    sequence: int
    agent_id: str
    session_id: str
```

### WebSocket Message Format
```typescript
interface ChannelMessageNotification {
  type: "channel_message";
  channel: "analysis" | "commentary" | "final";
  content: string;
  metadata: {
    sequence: number;
    timestamp: string;
    agentId: string;
    sessionId: string;
    [key: string]: any;
  };
}
```

## Migration Strategy
1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Support legacy single-channel responses
   - Auto-convert old format to new
   - Gradual rollout with feature flags

2. **Incremental Adoption**
   - Start with new sessions only
   - Add channel support to one agent at a time
   - Monitor and adjust based on usage

3. **Data Migration**
   - Keep existing chat history
   - Tag historical messages with default channel
   - No breaking changes

## Benefits
1. **Clean Separation**: No more JSON in user responses
2. **Better Control**: Fine-grained control over visibility
3. **Improved UX**: Cleaner, more professional responses
4. **Developer Tools**: Analysis channel for debugging
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new channels later

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Channel routing logic
   - Message parsing
   - Channel detection

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end channel flow
   - WebSocket streaming
   - Multi-agent scenarios

3. **UI Tests**
   - Channel display toggling
   - Preference persistence
   - Visual regression tests

## Success Metrics
- Zero JSON/metadata in final channel
- User satisfaction with response clarity
- Reduced support tickets about "weird text"
- Developer productivity improvements
- Performance impact < 5%

## Future Extensions
- Custom channels for specific use cases
- Channel-based permissions
