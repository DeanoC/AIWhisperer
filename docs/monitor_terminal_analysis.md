# Terminal Monitor Layout Requirements Analysis

This document outlines the detailed requirements for the new terminal monitor layout, based on the goal to "Improve the monitor terminal display by splitting it into three segmented, outlined sections with colored output and suppressed non-monitor content."

## 1. Screen Splitting

* **Requirement 1.1:** The terminal screen shall be split into three main horizontal segments.
* **Requirement 1.2:** The central segment shall be further subdivided vertically, with the larger top part dedicated to the primary monitor output and a smaller bottom part reserved for a command box (future use).
* **Requirement 1.3:** The left and right segments are currently designated to be empty but should be available for future content.

## 2. Segment Sizing

* **Requirement 2.1:** The central segment shall be significantly wider than the left and right segments.
  * *Clarification needed:* Specific ratios or percentage widths for the three horizontal segments (e.g., Left: 20%, Center: 60%, Right: 20%).
* **Requirement 2.2:** Within the central segment, the top (monitor output) area shall be significantly larger than the bottom (command box) area.
  * *Clarification needed:* Specific height ratio or percentage for the monitor output vs. command box (e.g., Monitor: 80%, Command Box: 20% of the central segment's height).

## 3. ASCII Outlines

* **Requirement 3.1:** All primary segments (left, center, right) shall be visually separated and outlined using ASCII art boxes.
* **Requirement 3.2:** The subdivision within the central segment (monitor output and command box) should also be clearly delineated, potentially with a horizontal ASCII line.
* **Requirement 3.3:** The ASCII art should be simple, clean, and not interfere with the readability of the content within the segments.

## 4. Output Suppression

* **Requirement 4.1:** All non-monitor related output (e.g., general CLI tool logs, debugging information not intended for the monitor) shall be suppressed from the main terminal window where the monitor display is active.
* **Requirement 4.2:** The primary monitor output area in the central segment should display only designated monitor events and information.
  * *Clarification needed:* Mechanism for how non-monitor output is handled (e.g., redirected to a log file, completely discarded, or accessible via a separate view/command).

## 5. Coloring

* **Requirement 5.1:** Different types of terminal events or log levels displayed in the monitor shall be distinguished using colors.
  * *Clarification needed:* Specific color scheme for different event types/levels (e.g., INFO: blue, WARNING: yellow, ERROR: red, DEBUG: gray).
* **Requirement 5.2:** JSON strings, or strings containing JSON, displayed in the monitor shall be pretty-printed.
* **Requirement 5.3:** Pretty-printed JSON shall also utilize syntax highlighting with colors to improve readability.
  * *Clarification needed:* Specific color scheme for JSON elements (e.g., keys, string values, number values, booleans).

## Summary of Clarifications Needed

* Specific width ratios/percentages for the three main horizontal segments.
* Specific height ratio/percentage for the monitor output vs. command box within the central segment.
* Mechanism for handling suppressed non-monitor output.
* Detailed color scheme for different event types/log levels.
* Detailed color scheme for JSON syntax highlighting.

This analysis will serve as the basis for the design and implementation of the improved terminal monitor display.
