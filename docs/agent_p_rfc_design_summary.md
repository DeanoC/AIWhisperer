# Agent P RFC Refinement - Design Summary

## Quick Overview

Agent P (Patricia) will be AIWhisperer's RFC specialist, helping users transform vague ideas into well-structured requirements through conversational refinement.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Conversational Refinement**
- Natural language interaction, not forms
- Guided questioning based on context
- Iterative improvement process
- No overwhelming users with too many questions at once

### 2. **RFC Lifecycle**
```
new → in_progress → ready → (planning phase) → archived
```
- Clear status transitions
- History tracking at each stage
- Ability to move backwards if needed

### 3. **Tool Categories**

**RFC Management**: Create, read, update, move, list RFCs
**Codebase Analysis**: Understand project context
**Web Research**: Find best practices and examples

### 4. **Smart Features**
- Auto-detect programming languages
- Find similar existing code
- Search for implementation patterns
- Generate unique RFC IDs with timestamps

### 5. **Integration Points**
- Seamless fit with existing agent system
- Uses current PathManager for security
- Leverages existing tool infrastructure
- Compatible with both CLI and interactive modes

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start Simple**: Basic RFC CRUD operations first
2. **Add Intelligence**: Codebase analysis next
3. **External Knowledge**: Web search last
4. **Iterate**: Refine based on usage patterns

## Example Flow

```
User: "I want to add caching to our API"
Agent P: "I'll help you refine this. What type of data needs caching?"
User: "User profiles and permissions"
Agent P: "What's your expected cache invalidation strategy?"
[... continues until RFC is complete ...]
```

## Success Metrics

- Time from idea to structured RFC < 15 minutes
- Less than 10 clarifying questions per RFC
- 90% of RFCs ready for planning without major revisions
- Users feel guided, not interrogated

## Why This Approach?

1. **Low Friction**: Users can start with just an idea
2. **Context Aware**: Analyzes existing code for relevance  
3. **Best Practices**: Researches proven solutions
4. **Structured Output**: Consistent RFC format for planning phase
5. **Traceable**: Full history of refinement process

This design prioritizes user experience while maintaining technical rigor, making requirement gathering a collaborative rather than bureaucratic process.
