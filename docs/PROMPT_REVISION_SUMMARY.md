# Prompt Revision Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis
- Analyzed all current AIWhisperer prompts (global and agent-specific)
- Studied advanced systems (Claude-Code, ChatGPT, Manus)
- Identified key patterns for improvement

### 2. Key Insights Discovered

#### From Claude-Code
- Extreme conciseness (<4 lines)
- No conversational fluff
- Direct, technical communication

#### From ChatGPT
- Strict channel separation (analysis vs commentary)
- Channel-specific tool restrictions
- Clear output formatting

#### From Manus
- Structured agent loops (one tool per step)
- Autonomous operation until completion
- Explicit standby states

### 3. Created Deliverables

#### Analysis Document
`/docs/PROMPT_REVISION_ANALYSIS.md` - Complete analysis with:
- Current state assessment
- Issues identified
- Specific recommendations
- Implementation roadmap
- Expected outcomes

#### Example Revised Prompts
1. `/prompts/shared/core_revised.md` - New core system prompt
2. `/prompts/agents/alice_assistant_revised.md` - Revised Alice prompt

#### Metrics Tool
`/tools/prompt_metrics_tool.py` - Automated measurement of:
- Channel compliance
- Response conciseness  
- Autonomous behavior
- Comparison between versions
- **Tool usage patterns** (NEW)
  - Success/failure rates per tool
  - Common error patterns
  - Execution times
  - Tool selection accuracy

## Key Improvements Recommended

### 1. Structured Agent Loop
```
ANALYZE → PLAN → EXECUTE → EVALUATE → ITERATE/COMPLETE
```
One tool per iteration for predictable behavior

### 2. Mandatory Channel Usage
```
[ANALYSIS] - Internal reasoning only
[COMMENTARY] - Tool execution details
[FINAL] - User-facing response (max 4 lines)
```

### 3. Autonomous Operation
- Work independently by default
- Only interrupt for critical decisions
- Clear completion criteria
- Explicit standby state

### 4. Conciseness Rules
- Max 4 lines in FINAL section
- No preambles ("Great!", "I'll help you...")
- Direct, technical language
- Action over explanation

## Validation Strategy

### Metrics to Track
1. **Channel Compliance Rate** - Target: 100%
2. **Average Word Count** - Target: <50 words per response
3. **Permission Seeking** - Target: <10% of responses
4. **Task Completion Rate** - Target: >80% without user prompts
5. **User Satisfaction** - Via feedback ratings
6. **Tool Success Rate** - Target: >95% successful executions
7. **Tool Selection Accuracy** - Target: >90% correct first choice
8. **Tool Error Patterns** - Identify top 3 for improvement

### A/B Testing Plan
- Week 1: Deploy to Alice (highest usage)
- Week 2: Add Patricia (clear workflow)
- Week 3: Full deployment
- Week 4: Analysis and refinement

### Success Criteria
- 50% reduction in response verbosity
- 40% faster task completion
- 60% increase in autonomous completion
- 70% channel compliance rate

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review and approve revised prompts
2. Set up A/B testing infrastructure
3. Deploy revised core.md to test environment
4. Begin collecting baseline metrics

### Week 1 Tasks
1. Implement revised Alice prompt
2. Deploy prompt_metrics_tool
3. Start collecting data
4. Monitor for issues

### Ongoing
1. Weekly metrics review
2. Iterate based on data
3. Expand to other agents
4. Document learnings

## Benefits Expected

### For Users
- Faster responses
- Less back-and-forth
- Clearer communication
- More predictable behavior

### For Development
- Easier to debug issues
- Clear performance metrics
- Systematic improvement process
- Better agent specialization

## Conclusion

The prompt revision focuses on three core principles:
1. **Structure** - Predictable agent behavior through loops
2. **Clarity** - Mandatory channels and concise output
3. **Autonomy** - Independent operation by default

These changes align AIWhisperer with best practices from leading AI systems while maintaining its unique multi-agent architecture.
