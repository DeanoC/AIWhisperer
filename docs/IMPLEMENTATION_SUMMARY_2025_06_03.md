# Implementation Summary - June 3, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented per-agent AI loops (Phases 1 & 2) from the "Async Multi-Agent Workflows" feature, along with fixes for Patricia's tool usage and Alice's agent switching capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Per-Agent AI Loops ✓
**Goal**: Enable each agent to use different AI models based on their specific needs.

**Implementation**:
- Created `AILoopFactory` for instantiating AI loops with different configurations
- Created `AILoopManager` to manage per-agent AI loop instances  
- Modified `StatelessSessionManager` to use AILoopManager
- Updated agent configurations to support `ai_config` settings

**Results**:
- Debbie: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo (fast, temperature 0.5, 2000 tokens)
- Eamonn: Uses Claude-3-Opus (powerful, temperature 0.7, 8000 tokens)
- Others: Use default model from global config

### 2. Patricia's Tool Usage Fix ✓
**Problem**: Patricia would use tools without providing explanatory text (Gemini model behavior).

**Solution**: Updated Patricia's prompt to explicitly require explanatory text:
```markdown
**IMPORTANT**: Always provide explanatory text when using tools. 
Never use a tool without first explaining what you're about to do and why. 
This helps users understand your actions.
```

### 3. Alice's Agent Switching ✓
**Problem**: Alice couldn't switch between agents - `recommend_external_agent` was for external tools only.

**Solution**:
- Created new `SwitchAgentTool` for internal agent switching
- Updated Alice's prompt with detailed switching instructions
- Registered the tool in the system

**Example Usage**:
```python
switch_agent(
    agent_id="p",
    reason="User needs to create RFCs",
    context_summary="User wants to create RFCs for features"
)
```

## Technical Architecture

### Key Components
1. **AILoopFactory**: Factory pattern for creating AI loops
2. **AILoopManager**: Manager pattern for agent->AI loop mappings
3. **AILoopConfig**: Configuration dataclass for AI settings
4. **SwitchAgentTool**: Tool for agent handoffs

### Design Decisions
- Non-singleton AI loops (already good architecture)
- Lazy creation of AI loops (created on first use)
- Configuration inheritance (agent config overrides global)
- Tool-based agent switching (fits existing architecture)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/ai_whisperer/services/execution/ai_loop_factory.py`
- `/ai_whisperer/services/agents/ai_loop_manager.py`
- `/ai_whisperer/tools/switch_agent_tool.py`
- `/docs/PER_AGENT_AI_LOOPS_PLAN.md`

### Modified Files
- `/interactive_server/stateless_session_manager.py`
- `/config/agents/agents.yaml`
- `/prompts/agents/agent_patricia.prompt.md`
- `/prompts/agents/alice_assistant.prompt.md`

## Testing Results
All tests passed successfully:
- ✓ Per-agent AI loops working (each agent uses configured model)
- ✓ Patricia's prompt includes explanatory text requirements
- ✓ Alice can switch agents using new tool
- ✓ All implementation files in place

## Future Considerations

### Phase 3 (Not Implemented)
- Concurrent agent execution
- Inter-agent communication protocols
- Shared context management

### Architectural Transition
The system is transitioning from single-active-agent to multi-agent communication paradigm. Current implementation provides the foundation for this future work.

### Known Limitations
1. Session context not passed to tools (noted for future work)
2. Agent switching is complete handoff (no parallel work yet)
3. No inter-agent messaging system yet

## Conclusion
Successfully completed Phases 1 & 2 of the per-agent AI loops implementation, fixed Patricia's tool usage issue, and enabled Alice to switch between agents. The system now supports different AI models per agent and provides better user experience with explanatory text for tool usage.
