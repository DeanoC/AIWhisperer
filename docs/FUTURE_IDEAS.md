## Async Multi-Agent Workflows (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Independent Agent AI Loops with Mailbox Coordination
Revolutionary architecture where each agent runs its own AI loop independently, enabling true parallel multi-agent workflows:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  Agent E    │    │  Agent C    │    │  Agent P    │
│ (AI Loop 1) │◄──►│ (AI Loop 2) │◄──►│ (AI Loop 3) │
│ Plan Mgmt   │    │ Coding      │    │ RFC Design  │
└─────┬───────┘    └─────┬───────┘    └─────┬───────┘
      │                  │                  │
      └──────────────────┼──────────────────┘
                         │
                   ┌─────▼───────┐
                   │  Mailbox    │
                   │  System     │
                   └─────────────┘
```

**Agent Capabilities:**
- 🛌 **Sleep/Wake Control**: Agents can sleep on timers or events, wake up to check progress
- 📬 **Async Mailbox Communication**: "Hey Colin, can you implement this task?"
- 🔄 **Progress Monitoring**: "Alice, update me when user responds"
- ⚡ **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working simultaneously on different aspects
- 🤝 **Agent Coordination**: Agents can request help, delegate tasks, and collaborate

**Example Workflows:**
- **Agent E** decomposes plan → sleeps while **Agent C** codes individual tasks → wakes to commit completed work
- **Agent P** works on RFC planning while **Agent M** manages context in background
- **Alice** handles user interaction while specialized agents collaborate behind the scenes
- **Agent E** periodically checks task status and coordinates next steps

**Technical Architecture:**
- Independent AI session per agent
- Async task queues and event systems  
- Agent sleep/wake scheduling
- Mailbox-driven inter-agent communication
- Conflict resolution for shared resources
- Agent lifecycle management

**Benefits:**
- True parallel agent workflows
- Agents can specialize without blocking others
- Complex multi-step tasks can be decomposed and executed in parallel
- User interaction remains responsive while background work continues
- Natural delegation and collaboration patterns

**Implementation Challenges:**
- Managing multiple AI loops without conflicts
- Agent coordination and synchronization
- Resource sharing and locking
- Error handling across agent boundaries
- Debugging multi-agent interactions

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Enhancements

### Connection Pooling for MCP Client

  - Connection timeout and retry strategies
  - Metrics for pool utilization and performance

## Random unstructured ideas
- MCP server ✅ (Implemented)
- MCP client ✅ (Implemented Phase 1)
- Alice to get a new project setup feature (can talk to agent P by mail for ideas on languages etc.)
- Agent C - Colin the Coder specialist coder. To coding tasks in Agent E plans
- Agent M - Mary the Memory. Reasonable for context manager + compact + per agent & project memory storage
- Our workspace project file only support 1 git worktree at a time, would be good to allow multiple worktree so multi plans can be run at the some time in isolation
- Base git integration on the right view and provided to agents
- Agent E should commit after each successful task
- ~~https://manus.im/share/file/5c80a565-2a61-449a-8f2b-350e2c41333a Manus.im for continuation for AI (High priority)~~
- Idea notepad that the quick ideas can be added to and agent P can select one for a new efc and plan if the user asks it
- Github integration for an agent or as an Agent? Agent R Roger the Repo Man
- Massive doc cleanup
- PDF and image support
- drag and drop in the frontend
- Agent specific model and providers
- Alice has a knowledge base about AIWhisperer, other topics?, other agents can to find info
- Discoverable tool and sets. Start with descriptioons, agents can ask to use them and it inserted into there tool 
- 'Minor Agents' double letter names and a hidden from the roster, mostly used by agents via mailbox
- Think on the idea of 'agents as tools' specialist intelligent tools that other agents can use.
  - Intellignt merge
  - Websearcher
  - A/B tester - agents can ask to test which is better for a given criteria, A/B can apply optimisations techniques.
- Prompt development refinement / agentic approach? https://manus.im/share/WZHngJw4Woo44W0IxgcYbh?replay=1 https://github.com/dontriskit/awesome-ai-system-prompts
- AI useable debuggers https://manus.im/share/file/18d10fa9-12ea-475c-8ac8-5f66a371420c
- Add options to be less 'friendly' for experienced use. i.e. AI introductions can be short/missing, agent E always tells you how to use claude
- Integrate AI dynamic buttons in the message bubbles, allow agents to create buttons using the output markdown for easy user interaction


## Notes about conceptual framework for multi-agent systems:
Our interface is a chat system. The main chat is a group chat which all agents can be part of we can also have (in theory, not implelented yet) private chats with an agents and small group chats as well (not implemented yet).
The main group chat doesn't nessecarily have a focused agent in the real world. I chat to all my mates, some will reply some not. Group chats like discord, irc, slack, etc. are all like this.
The question is does that make sense for agents?
The primary issue is confusion for the agents and cost of all the AI listening to everything
An alternative is to have a primary agent that is the main chat agent and the others are secondary agents that can be called on
This would have the current UI active agent get the users messages and prehaps a @name at the start of the message to indicate which agent to send it to
this solves several issues:
- Agents can be focused on specific tasks
- Costs are reduced as only the active agent is processing messages
- Agents can 'wake up' and process the messages that have happened while they were asleep (though this might get complicated)
To really work we might need rooms
We have a mailbox system that allows agents to send messages to each other, this is a good way to allow agents to communicate without needing to be in the same chat.
The other paradigm is to not base it on a chat system and more like email. The user sends and recieves messages from agents, they can reply to messages and the agents can reply back. This biggest issue is that the user won't see much of the interaction between agents, which is a key part of the system.

Prehaps we always open 2 chats at start, a private one with Alice The Assistant and the main group chat. If you want a quiet life you can chat with alice who will update and route your messages to the correct agent/s. If you want to see the group chat you can but it might get rowdy like a real shared group chat...
