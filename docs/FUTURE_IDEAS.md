## Notes

- Items in this document are not prioritized
- Some ideas may conflict or overlap
- Consider user feedback before implementing
- Evaluate ROI for each feature
- Some features may require significant architectural changes

## Recently Deferred Items

### From Phase 4 Implementation
- Caching layer implementation (deferred due to time constraints)
  - Would significantly improve performance for large workspaces
  - Consider implementing before scaling to production

### From File Browser Implementation
- Advanced file operations (create, rename, delete)
  - Deferred to focus on read-only operations first
  - Important for full file management capabilities
