# Analysis of Requirements for the First Full Runner Test

This document outlines the analysis of the requirements for the first full runner test, based on the information provided in [`project_dev/rfc/add_1st_runner_test.md`](project_dev/rfc/add_1st_runner_test.md).

## 1. Summarized Requirements

The primary goal of the first full runner test is to validate the runner's capability to successfully execute an overview plan and its associated subtasks. This involves the AI, orchestrated by the runner, performing the following:

* Generating a Python script based on a given requirement.
* Executing the generated script.
* Verifying the output of the script.
* Reporting the overall success or failure of the task.
The test aims to ensure the runner can manage this entire lifecycle without any special hardcoding for the specific test case, thereby testing the runner's generic execution capabilities.

## 2. Identified Steps for the Runner

The runner, in conjunction with the AI, is expected to perform the following steps to fulfill the test requirements:

1. **Ingest Plan:** The runner ingests the overview plan and its defined subtasks for the test requirement.
2. **Generate Script (Subtask):** Guided by a subtask, the AI generates a Python script. The script's purpose is to calculate a sequence of squares (starting at 2, doubling each iteration, for 32 iterations) and write this sequence to a file named `test.txt`. This step will likely involve the `write_file` tool.
3. **Execute Script (Subtask):** The AI executes the generated Python script. This is a critical step that necessitates the new `execute_command` tool.
4. **Read Output File (Subtask):** The AI reads the content of the `test.txt` file generated by the script. This will likely involve the `read_file` tool.
5. **Verify Output (Subtask):** The AI analyzes the content read from `test.txt` to confirm that it matches the expected sequence of squares, thereby validating the script's correctness.
6. **Report Result (Subtask):** Based on the verification, the AI reports the overall success or failure of the task.

## 3. Justification for the `execute_command` Tool

The [`project_dev/rfc/add_1st_runner_test.md`](project_dev/rfc/add_1st_runner_test.md) document explicitly states the necessity of a new tool, `execute_command`.

* Line 15 mentions: "A side effect is that this will require a new AI tool execute_command so the AI can run the python script it run and check the output."
* Line 26 reiterates: "It will *require* a new tool to execute the script itself (execute_command), it should read the test.txt output and produce success or failure."

This tool is essential because the AI needs a mechanism to run the Python script it generates. Without `execute_command`, the runner cannot complete the test cycle, as it would be unable to trigger the script's execution and subsequently verify its output against the requirements.

## 4. High-Level Execution Flow

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the anticipated flow of execution for the runner during this test:

graph TD
    A[Start: Runner receives Overview Plan for Test Requirement] --> B{Process Subtasks};
    B -- Subtask 1: Generate Script --> C[AI generates Python script (e.g., `script.py`) to calculate squares and write to 'test.txt'];
    C -- Uses write_file tool --> D[Python script created on disk];
    B -- Subtask 2: Execute Script --> E[AI executes `script.py`];
    E -- Uses execute_command tool --> F[Script runs, 'test.txt' is generated/updated];
    B -- Subtask 3: Read Output File --> G[AI reads 'test.txt'];
    G -- Uses read_file tool --> H[Content of 'test.txt' obtained];
    B -- Subtask 4: Verify Output --> I[AI analyzes 'test.txt' content to verify correctness against requirements];
    I --> J[AI determines success/failure of the script execution and output];
    B -- Subtask 5: Report Result --> K[AI reports overall task success/failure based on verification];
    K --> L[End: Test Completion];
