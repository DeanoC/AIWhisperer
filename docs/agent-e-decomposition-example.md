# Agent E Task Decomposition Example

This document captures the real-world process of decomposing the Agent E implementation plan, serving as a concrete example of how Agent E should approach task decomposition in the future.

## Date: 2025-05-31
## Agent: Claude (acting as proto-Agent E)
## Target Plan: Agent E Implementation Plan

## Initial Analysis Process

### 1. Understanding the Overall Scope
When I first read the Agent E RFC and plan, I performed several analytical steps:

1. **Scope Assessment**: 
   - Identified this as a complex, multi-phase project
   - Noted the emphasis on discovery/prototyping before implementation
   - Recognized the human-in-the-middle approach for external agents

2. **Complexity Evaluation**:
   - 23 tasks in the plan
   - Multiple integration points (Agent P, external agents, AIWhisperer core)
   - Clear TDD phases requiring careful sequencing

3. **Risk Identification**:
   - Many unknowns acknowledged in RFC
   - External agent integration without clear APIs
   - Need for tool discovery through usage

### 2. Identifying the Starting Point

Looking at the plan's task list, I identified the natural starting point:

**Selected Task**: "Analyze existing AIWhisperer architecture for Agent E integration"

**Why This Task First**:
- No dependencies, can start immediately
- Foundational knowledge needed for all subsequent work
- Low risk, high information value
- Aligns with discovery phase philosophy

## Task Decomposition Process

### Task: "Analyze existing AIWhisperer architecture for Agent E integration"

#### Step 1: Clarifying the Task Intent
First, I considered what this task really needs to accomplish:
- Understand how agents currently work in AIWhisperer
- Identify integration patterns we can follow
- Find potential conflicts or challenges
- Document findings for future reference

#### Step 2: Breaking Down into Concrete Actions

**Subtask 1: Study Agent P Implementation**
```yaml
description: |
  Examine the complete Agent P implementation to understand the agent 
  architecture patterns used in AIWhisperer
context_needed:
  - Agent P source files location
  - Current agent registration mechanism
  - Tool access patterns for agents
specific_files_to_examine:
  - ai_whisperer/agents/planner_handler.py
  - ai_whisperer/agents/registry.py
  - ai_whisperer/agents/config/agents.yaml
  - prompts/agents/agent_patricia.prompt.md
deliverables:
  - Notes on agent initialization process
  - Understanding of agent-tool interaction
  - List of Agent P's capabilities and limitations
acceptance_criteria:
  - Can explain how Agent P receives and processes messages
  - Understand the tool registration process for agents
  - Document the agent switching mechanism if it exists
```

**Subtask 2: Map Current Tool System Architecture**
```yaml
description: |
  Create a comprehensive map of the current tool system that Agent E 
  will need to integrate with
context_needed:
  - Tool registry implementation
  - How tools are made available to agents
  - Tool permission and filtering mechanisms
specific_actions:
  - Trace tool lifecycle from registration to execution
  - Identify tool interface requirements
  - Understand tool result handling
specific_files_to_examine:
  - ai_whisperer/tools/tool_registry.py
  - ai_whisperer/tools/base_tool.py
  - ai_whisperer/agents/base_handler.py
deliverables:
  - Tool system architecture diagram
  - List of tool interface requirements
  - Understanding of tool permission model
```

**Subtask 3: Analyze Agent Communication Patterns**
```yaml
description: |
  Understand how agents currently communicate with each other and the
  AI loop to design Agent E's interaction model
context_needed:
  - Current agent-to-agent communication (if any)
  - Message routing in the system
  - Context preservation mechanisms
specific_investigations:
  - Check if agents can currently invoke other agents
  - Understand session and context management
  - Trace a complete message flow through the system
specific_files_to_examine:
  - ai_whisperer/agents/session_manager.py
  - ai_whisperer/agents/context_manager.py
  - interactive_server/stateless_session_manager.py
deliverables:
  - Communication flow diagram
  - List of integration points for Agent E
  - Gaps that need to be filled for agent collaboration
```

**Subtask 4: Document Integration Requirements**
```yaml
description: |
  Synthesize findings into clear integration requirements and 
  recommendations for Agent E implementation
context_needed:
  - All findings from previous subtasks
  - RFC requirements for Agent E
  - Current system constraints
specific_outputs:
  - Integration strategy document
  - List of required new tools for Agent E
  - Compatibility requirements
  - Recommended implementation approach
validation:
  - Review with team/stakeholders
  - Ensure alignment with RFC goals
  - Verify technical feasibility
```

## Key Insights on Task Decomposition

### 1. Context is Critical
Each subtask needs:
- **Why**: Clear purpose and connection to larger goal
- **What**: Specific actions and investigations
- **Where**: Exact files/components to examine
- **Output**: Concrete deliverables
- **Success**: Clear acceptance criteria

### 2. Granularity Balance
Tasks should be:
- Small enough to complete in 1-4 hours
- Large enough to produce meaningful progress
- Self-contained with clear boundaries
- Verifiable with specific criteria

### 3. Information Architecture
For each subtask, I provided:
- Specific files to examine (reducing search time)
- Exact questions to answer (focused investigation)
- Required context (what knowledge is needed)
- Expected outputs (what "done" looks like)

### 4. Progressive Understanding
The subtasks build on each other:
1. Understand existing patterns (Agent P)
2. Map the infrastructure (Tools)
3. Analyze interactions (Communication)
4. Synthesize and plan (Documentation)

## Metrics and Observations

### Time Estimates (Hypothetical)
- Subtask 1: 2-3 hours (code reading and note-taking)
- Subtask 2: 3-4 hours (more complex tracing)
- Subtask 3: 2-3 hours (focused investigation)
- Subtask 4: 1-2 hours (synthesis and writing)
- **Total**: 8-12 hours for complete analysis

### Decomposition Metrics
- Original task: 1 vague task
- Decomposed into: 4 concrete subtasks
- Information density: ~15-20 specific items to investigate
- Clarity improvement: From "analyze architecture" to specific file lists and questions

### Key Success Factors
1. **Specific File References**: Eliminates guesswork
2. **Clear Questions**: Focuses the investigation
3. **Concrete Deliverables**: Makes progress measurable
4. **Building Understanding**: Each task adds to knowledge

## Recommendations for Agent E Implementation

### 1. Task Template Structure
```yaml
task:
  name: "Clear, action-oriented name"
  description: "Detailed explanation of what and why"
  context_needed:
    - "Required background knowledge"
    - "Dependencies on other work"
  specific_actions:
    - "Concrete step 1"
    - "Concrete step 2"
  files_to_examine:
    - "path/to/specific/file.py"
  deliverables:
    - "Specific output 1"
    - "Specific output 2"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Measurable criterion 1"
    - "Measurable criterion 2"
  estimated_time: "X-Y hours"
  external_agent_suitability: "high|medium|low"
  suggested_agent: "Claude Code|RooCode|GitHub Copilot"
```

### 2. Decomposition Heuristics
- If a task mentions "analyze" or "research", break it into specific investigations
- If a task mentions "implement", list the specific components to build
- If a task mentions "test", specify exact test scenarios
- Always include file paths when known
- Always include questions to answer
- Always define what "complete" looks like

### 3. Context Preservation
When Agent E decomposes tasks, it should:
- Maintain links to source RFC sections
- Preserve the "why" from the original plan
- Include relevant system constraints
- Reference related tasks and dependencies

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates that effective task decomposition requires:
1. Deep understanding of the task intent
2. Specific, actionable subtasks with clear context
3. Concrete deliverables and acceptance criteria
4. Progressive building of understanding
5. Balance between detail and overwhelm

Agent E should aim to provide this level of specificity while adapting to the target agent's capabilities and the user's preferences for detail level.
