# Textual Framework Setup Analysis

This document outlines the requirements and analysis for setting up the Textual UI framework for the AI Conversation Tool, considering the existing plan and the need to integrate it with the current application structure.

## Key Findings

Textual is a strong fit for the project's needs, aligning with requirements for a hybrid terminal/web interface, robust text/code handling, and an AI-friendly architecture.

## Setup Requirements

1. **Installation**: Add `textual` and `textual-dev` to project dependencies.
2. **Core Structure**: Develop an `InteractiveApp` class (as anticipated in `ai_whisperer/main.py`) within a new `ai_whisperer.ui.interactive_app` module. This app will utilize Textual widgets such as `TabbedContent` and `TextArea` to structure the UI.
3. **Integration with `ai_whisperer`**:
    * The Textual `InteractiveApp` will be launched from `ai_whisperer/main.py` when the `config.get("interactive")` flag is true.
    * The `InteractiveApp` instance will be initialized with the `delegate_manager` to facilitate communication with the backend.
    * Connect UI actions (e.g., button clicks, text input) to the `ai_whisperer` backend AI logic using Textual's `Worker` and `Message` system. This will leverage the `delegate_manager` for asynchronous communication between the UI thread and the main application thread.
4. **Important Considerations**:
    * Define a clear API between the UI components and the backend logic, primarily through the `delegate_manager`.
    * Carefully manage asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the UI thread.
    * Ensure robust error handling within the Textual application and its interactions with the backend.
5. **Future Scope**: The initial setup should provide a foundation that supports later enhancements, including real-time updates of AI responses in the UI and dynamic UI adjustments based on the application state.
