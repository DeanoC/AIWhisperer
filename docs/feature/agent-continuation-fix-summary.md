# Agent Continuation System - Fix Summary

## Issue Found and Fixed

After implementing the agent continuation system, agents using single-tool models (like Gemini) were not able to continue even when sending explicit continuation signals. The issue was in the order of checks in `_should_continue_after_tools()`.

## Root Cause

The method was checking model capabilities BEFORE checking for explicit continuation signals from the agent's ContinuationStrategy. Since Gemini is a single-tool model, it would return `False` immediately, never giving the continuation strategy a chance to detect explicit signals.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Reordered Logic in Session Manager (✅ Complete)

Updated `_should_continue_after_tools()` in `/home/deano/projects/AIWhisperer/interactive_server/stateless_session_manager.py`:
- Moved continuation strategy check to the TOP of the method
- Added logging for continuation strategy decisions
- Preserved fallback logic for agents without continuation strategies

### 2. Added Continuation Config to All Agents (✅ Complete)

Updated `/home/deano/projects/AIWhisperer/ai_whisperer/agents/config/agents.yaml`:
- Added `continuation_config` to all agents (Alice, Patricia, Tessa, Eamonn)
- Standardized Debbie's continuation config to match the new format
- Configuration enables explicit signal detection with appropriate limits

Example configuration:
```yaml
continuation_config:
  require_explicit_signal: true
  max_iterations: 5
  timeout: 300
```

### 3. Created Tests (✅ Complete)

Added comprehensive tests in `/home/deano/projects/AIWhisperer/tests/integration/test_agent_continuation_fix.py`:
- Test that continuation strategy is checked before model capability
- Test that explicit CONTINUE signals work on single-tool models
- Test that TERMINATE signals prevent continuation
- Test that agents initialize continuation strategy from config

## How It Works Now

1. When an agent uses tools, the session manager checks for continuation
2. If the agent has a ContinuationStrategy, it checks for explicit signals FIRST
3. Only if no strategy exists does it fall back to model capability checks
4. Single-tool models can now continue if they send explicit CONTINUE signals

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:
1. Start the interactive server
2. Switch to any agent (e.g., Alice with `@a`)
3. Ask for a multi-step task (e.g., "List files in .WHISPER then summarize each")
4. The agent should:
   - Use a tool (list_directory)
   - Include a continuation signal in its response structure
   - Automatically continue to the next step
   - No JSON should appear in the chat (due to our earlier protocol fix)

## Benefits

- All agents can now perform multi-step operations autonomously
- Works with both single-tool and multi-tool models
- Explicit control through continuation signals
- Backward compatible with existing behavior

## Commits

Two key commits in this session:
1. Fixed continuation protocol to prevent JSON display in chat
2. Fixed continuation detection order and added configs for all agents
