# Agent Continuation System Implementation Progress

## Summary

We've successfully completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the agent continuation system implementation. The system now supports:

1. **Enhanced PromptSystem with shared components**
2. **Comprehensive continuation strategy module**
3. **Full test coverage for both components**

## Phase 1: Enhanced PromptSystem ✅

### Completed Items:
- ✅ Added `_shared_components` dictionary to PromptSystem
- ✅ Implemented `_load_shared_components()` method
- ✅ Added `enable_feature()` and `disable_feature()` methods
- ✅ Extended `get_formatted_prompt()` with shared component injection
- ✅ Created `prompts/shared/` directory structure
- ✅ Written all shared prompt files:
  - `core.md` - Core system instructions
  - `continuation_protocol.md` - Continuation protocol with detailed format
  - `mailbox_protocol.md` - Inter-agent communication protocol
  - `tool_guidelines.md` - Tool usage best practices
  - `output_format.md` - Structured output requirements
  - `README.md` - Documentation for shared prompts
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (13 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Integration tests for real prompt loading
- ✅ Performance tests (5 tests, all passing)

### Key Features:
- Shared components are automatically loaded on PromptSystem initialization
- Features can be enabled/disabled at runtime
- Consistent ordering of components in prompts
- Backward compatibility with `include_shared` parameter
- Special handling for continuation and mailbox protocols

## Phase 2: Continuation Strategy Module ✅

### Completed Items:
- ✅ Created new `ContinuationStrategy` class with protocol support
- ✅ Implemented `ContinuationProgress` dataclass for tracking
- ✅ Implemented `ContinuationState` dataclass for state management
- ✅ Added explicit continuation signal detection
- ✅ Fallback pattern matching for backward compatibility
- ✅ Safety limits (max iterations and timeout)
- ✅ Context update with history tracking
- ✅ Progress tracking and reporting
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (24 tests, all passing)

### Key Features:
- Supports explicit continuation protocol (preferred)
- Falls back to pattern matching if needed
- Tracks iteration count and elapsed time
- Maintains continuation history
- Extracts next actions from responses
- Safety limits prevent infinite loops

## Code Quality

- ✅ All tests passing (37 total)
- ✅ No syntax errors (flake8 check passed)
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Type hints where appropriate
- ✅ Clear documentation and docstrings

## Next Steps: Phase 3 - Agent Integration

The foundation is now in place. Phase 3 will involve:

1. **Update StatelessAgent** to properly initialize continuation strategy
2. **Modify session manager** to use enhanced continuation detection
3. **Enable continuation feature** in PromptSystem during agent init
4. **Add progress notifications** via WebSocket
5. **Test with multiple agents** to ensure consistency

## Usage Example

Once fully integrated, agents will be able to:

```python
# Agent response with continuation
{
  "response": "I've listed the existing RFCs. Now I'll create the new one.",
  "continuation": {
    "status": "CONTINUE",
    "reason": "Need to create RFC after listing",
    "next_action": {
      "type": "tool_call",
      "tool": "create_rfc",
      "description": "Create new RFC for dark mode"
    },
    "progress": {
      "current_step": 1,
      "total_steps": 2,
      "completion_percentage": 50,
      "steps_completed": ["Listed existing RFCs"],
      "steps_remaining": ["Create new RFC"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Details

### PromptSystem Enhancement
- Shared components loaded from `prompts/shared/` directory
- Components injected in alphabetical order for consistency
- Core feature always enabled, others configurable
- Minimal performance overhead (<10ms for composition)

### Continuation Strategy
- Protocol-first approach with fallback patterns
- Configurable safety limits (default: 10 iterations, 5 minutes)
- Rich progress tracking with step details
- Context preservation across iterations
- Backward compatible with existing code

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: System-wide features in one place
2. **Consistency**: All agents behave uniformly
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new capabilities
4. **Testing**: Isolated, comprehensive test coverage
5. **Performance**: Minimal overhead confirmed by tests
6. **Safety**: Built-in limits prevent runaway operations
