# Agent P RFC Refinement Feature - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Agent P (Patricia) will serve as the project's RFC (Request for Comments) processor, helping users refine raw ideas into well-structured requirements ready for implementation planning. This is the first of Agent P's roles in the AIWhisperer ecosystem.

## Core Functionality

### 1. RFC Processing Workflow

```
User Input → Agent P → RFC Creation/Refinement → In-Progress RFC → Ready for Planning
     ↑                          ↓
     └──── Questions/Chat ──────┘
```

### 2. RFC Folder Structure

```
project_root/
├── rfc/
│   ├── new/              # New, unrefined RFCs
│   ├── in_progress/      # RFCs being refined with Agent P
│   └── archived/         # Completed or abandoned RFCs
```

## Design Specifications

### RFC Document Format

Each RFC will be a markdown file with structured sections:

```markdown
# RFC: [Title]

**RFC ID**: RFC-YYYY-MM-DD-XXXX
**Status**: new | in_progress | ready | archived
**Created**: [Date]
**Last Updated**: [Date]
**Author**: [User/Agent P]

### Agent P Prompt Design

```markdown
You are Agent P (Patricia), the RFC refinement specialist for AIWhisperer. Your role is to help users transform raw ideas into well-structured requirements documents.

Your responsibilities:
1. Create and refine RFC documents
2. Ask clarifying questions to improve requirements
3. Research technical approaches and best practices
4. Analyze the codebase to understand context
5. Guide users through the refinement process

When a user presents an idea:
1. Assess if an RFC exists or needs creation
2. Ask targeted questions to clarify requirements
3. Research similar implementations
4. Structure the information into the RFC format
5. Iterate until requirements are clear and complete

You should be:
- Inquisitive but not overwhelming
- Technical but accessible
- Thorough but efficient
- Collaborative and encouraging
```

## Example Interaction

```
User: I want to add a feature that automatically formats code when files are saved

Agent P: I'll help you refine this into a proper RFC. Let me ask a few questions to better understand your requirements:

1. Which programming languages should support auto-formatting?
2. Should this be configurable per project or globally?
3. What formatting tools/standards do you prefer (e.g., Black for Python, Prettier for JS)?
4. Should it format on every save or be toggleable?

User: It should work for Python and JavaScript files. Make it configurable per project. Use Black and Prettier. And yes, it should be toggleable.

Agent P: Great! Let me research the codebase and create an RFC for this feature...

[Agent P analyzes codebase, searches for best practices, creates RFC]

Agent P: I've created RFC-2025-05-29-0001 for the auto-formatting feature. Based on my analysis:
- The project already uses file watchers in the FileService
- We can integrate with the existing tool system
- I found several approaches for implementing format-on-save

Here are a few more questions to complete the requirements:
1. Should formatting errors prevent file saving?
2. Do you want to see formatting changes highlighted before they're applied?
3. Should there be a keyboard shortcut to format without saving?

[Refinement continues until RFC is complete]
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Clear boundaries for Agent P's role
   - Defined RFC completion criteria
   - Time limits on refinement sessions

2. **Web Search Abuse**
   - Rate limiting
   - Result caching
   - Fallback to local analysis

3. **RFC Proliferation**
   - Auto-archiving old RFCs
   - Regular cleanup processes
   - Clear status indicators
