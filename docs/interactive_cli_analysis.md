# Interactive CLI Analysis

This document outlines the requirements for adding a new CLI option to enable interactive mode.

## Requirements

1. **Dedicated CLI Flag:** A specific command-line flag (e.g., `--interactive`) is required to activate the interactive mode.
2. **Compatibility:** The implementation must ensure that existing non-interactive CLI functionality remains unaffected.
3. **Textual Framework:** The Textual framework will be used for the interactive UI. This involves dynamically swapping the standard output delegate with a Textual-based interactive delegate. The original delegate should be restored upon exiting the interactive mode.
4. **Session Duration:** Interactive sessions should be able to persist beyond the duration of individual AI computations. The system should also support graceful termination of the interactive session (e.g., via a Double Ctrl-C key combination).
5. **Multi-threaded Architecture:** The UI should run on a separate thread from the AI processing to maintain responsiveness.
6. **Delegate System:** All communication with AI components must be routed through the existing delegate system.
