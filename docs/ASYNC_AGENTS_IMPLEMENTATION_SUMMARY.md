# Async Agents Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented both synchronous and asynchronous multi-agent communication patterns for AIWhisperer.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Synchronous Agent Communication
- Discovered existing `AgentSwitchHandler` that enables synchronous agent switching via `send_mail`
- Created `send_mail_with_switch` tool for explicit synchronous communication
- Updated Alice's prompt to use the new synchronous pattern
- Agents can now get immediate responses from other agents

### 2. Asynchronous Agent Architecture
- Designed and implemented `AsyncAgentSessionManager` for managing multiple independent agent sessions
- Each agent runs its own AI loop independently
- Implemented agent states: IDLE, ACTIVE, SLEEPING, WAITING, STOPPED
- Created task queue system for asynchronous task processing
- Added sleep/wake functionality with timer and event-based wake patterns

### 3. WebSocket API Integration
- Created `AsyncAgentEndpoints` class with full JSON-RPC API
- Integrated endpoints into the main interactive server
- API methods include:
  - `async.createAgent` - Create new async agent
  - `async.startAgent` - Start agent processor
  - `async.stopAgent` - Stop agent
  - `async.sleepAgent` - Put agent to sleep
  - `async.wakeAgent` - Wake sleeping agent
  - `async.sendTask` - Send task to agent
  - `async.getAgentStates` - Get all agent states
  - `async.broadcastEvent` - Broadcast events to agents

### 4. Documentation and Testing
- Created comprehensive user guide: `docs/ASYNC_AGENTS_USER_GUIDE.md`
- Created demo script: `test_async_agents_demo.py`
- Updated CLAUDE.md with async agents information
- Created test scripts for both sync and async patterns

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AsyncAgentSessionManager** (`ai_whisperer/services/agents/async_session_manager.py`)
   - Manages multiple agent sessions with independent AI loops
   - Handles mailbox checking and task processing
   - Implements sleep/wake and event handling

2. **AsyncAgentEndpoints** (`interactive_server/async_agent_endpoints.py`)
   - WebSocket API endpoints for agent management
   - Handles session-scoped agent managers
   - Provides JSON-RPC interface

3. **Integration** (`interactive_server/main.py`)
   - Added async agent handlers to HANDLERS dictionary
   - Cleanup on session stop
   - Automatic initialization

## Usage Examples

### Synchronous Pattern
```python
# In an agent's action
send_mail_with_switch(
    to_agent="Debbie",
    subject="Debug this issue",
    body="I'm seeing an error in the test suite"
)
# Immediately receives Debbie's response
```

### Asynchronous Pattern
```javascript
// Create multiple agents
await sendRequest("async.createAgent", {
    sessionId: sessionId,
    agentId: "analyzer",
    autoStart: true
});

// Agents work independently in parallel
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Agent Persistence** - Save/restore agent state
2. **Distributed Execution** - Run agents on multiple servers
3. **Advanced Scheduling** - Cron-like scheduling
4. **Visual Monitoring** - Real-time workflow visualization

## Branch Information

All work is on the `feature/async-agents` branch, ready for testing and integration.
