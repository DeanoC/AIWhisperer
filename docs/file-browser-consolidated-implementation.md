## File Browser Implementation Plan

# File Browser Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of workspace file browsing, selection, and integration features for AIWhisperer, including:
- File browser UI in the sidebar
- @ command for file references in chat
- Backend APIs for file listing and searching
- AI tools for workspace exploration

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend Components

#### 1.1 File Browser Component (`frontend/src/components/FileBrowser.tsx`)
- Tree view display of workspace files
- Expand/collapse directories
- File icons based on type
- Search/filter functionality
- Integration with existing Sidebar component

#### 1.2 File Picker Modal (`frontend/src/components/FilePicker.tsx`)
- Triggered by @ command in MessageInput
- Fuzzy search for files
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter to select)
- Mouse selection support
- Recent files section

#### 1.3 @ Command Handler (enhance `frontend/src/MessageInput.tsx`)
- Detect @ character input
- Show file picker dropdown/modal
- Insert selected file reference into message
- Visual indication of file references (pill/tag style)

### 2. Backend APIs

#### 2.1 File Service (`interactive_server/services/file_service.py`)
```python
class FileService:
    async def list_directory(self, path: str, recursive: bool = False) -> FileTree
    async def search_files(self, query: str, file_types: List[str] = None) -> List[FileInfo]
    async def get_file_tree(self, max_depth: int = None) -> FileTree
    async def get_file_content(self, path: str) -> FileContent
```

#### 2.2 JSON-RPC Methods
- `workspace.listDirectory` - List files in a directory
- `workspace.searchFiles` - Search for files by name/content
- `workspace.getFileTree` - Get complete workspace tree
- `workspace.getFileContent` - Get file content (respecting permissions)

### 3. AI Tools

#### 3.1 Workspace Explorer Tool (`ai_whisperer/tools/workspace_explorer_tool.py`)
```python
class WorkspaceExplorerTool(BaseTool):
    def list_files(self, pattern: str = None, file_types: List[str] = None) -> List[str]
    def get_directory_tree(self, path: str = ".", max_depth: int = 3) -> str
    def find_files(self, query: str) -> List[FileMatch]
```

#### 3.2 File Reference Tool (`ai_whisperer/tools/file_reference_tool.py`)
```python
class FileReferenceTool(BaseTool):
    def add_file_to_context(self, file_path: str) -> FileContent
    def get_file_snippet(self, file_path: str, start_line: int, end_line: int) -> str
```

## Implementation Phases

1. Implement FileService with basic listing capabilities
2. Add JSON-RPC methods for file operations
3. Create workspace utility functions (tree generation, file filtering)
4. Add tests for file service

### Phase 2: Basic File Browser UI (Week 1-2) [DONE]
1. Create FileBrowser component with tree view
2. Integrate with existing Sidebar
3. Connect to backend APIs
4. Add loading states and error handling

### Phase 3: @ Command System (Week 2) [DONE]
1. Enhance MessageInput with @ detection
2. Create FilePicker modal component
3. Implement keyboard navigation
4. Add file reference rendering in messages

### Phase 4: AI Tools (Week 2-3)
1. Implement WorkspaceExplorerTool
2. Create FileReferenceTool
3. Register tools with agent system
4. Add tool tests

### Phase 5: Enhanced Features (Week 3)
1. File search functionality
2. File type filtering
3. Recent files tracking
4. File preview on hover
5. Drag-and-drop support

## Technical Details

### File Tree Data Structure
```typescript
interface FileNode {
  name: string;
  path: string;
  type: 'file' | 'directory';
  children?: FileNode[];
  size?: number;
  modified?: string;
  extension?: string;
}
```

### Message File Reference Format
```typescript
interface FileReference {
  path: string;
  displayName: string;
  lineRange?: [number, number];
}
```

### WebSocket Message Flow
1. Client requests file tree: `{"method": "workspace.getFileTree", "params": {"maxDepth": 3}}`
2. Server responds with tree structure
3. Client renders tree in sidebar
4. User selects file via @ command
5. File reference added to message
6. AI receives file context when processing message

## Security Considerations
- All file operations must respect PathManager restrictions
- No access outside workspace boundaries
- File content filtering for sensitive data
- Rate limiting on file operations

## UI/UX Considerations
- Lazy loading for large directories
- Virtual scrolling for performance
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+P for quick file search)
- Visual feedback for file operations
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for file operations
- E2E tests for @ command flow
- Performance tests for large workspaces
- Security tests for path traversal attempts

## Dependencies
- Frontend: Additional packages for tree view (react-arborist or similar)
- Backend: No new dependencies required
- Use existing PathManager for all file operations

## Migration Path
- Existing sidebar remains functional
- New features added incrementally
- No breaking changes to current APIs
- Gradual rollout with feature flags if needed

## File Browser Integration Summary

# File Browser Integration Summary

## Implementation Complete! ✅

Successfully implemented a file browser feature that displays the project's directory structure in an ASCII tree format, integrated with the AIWhisperer frontend.

## Components Created

### Backend
1. **FileService** (`interactive_server/services/file_service.py`)
   - Provides secure file system operations through PathManager
   - Methods: `get_tree_ascii()`, `list_directory()`, `search_files()`
   - Returns ASCII-formatted directory trees using existing `build_ascii_directory_tree()` from utils

2. **WorkspaceHandler** (`interactive_server/handlers/workspace_handler.py`)
   - JSON-RPC handler for workspace operations
   - Exposes methods: `workspace.getTree`, `workspace.listDirectory`, `workspace.searchFiles`
   - Integrated with the main server's handler registry

### Frontend
3. **FileBrowser Component** (`frontend/src/components/FileBrowser.tsx`)
   - React component displaying the file tree
   - Features:
     - Loading states
     - Error handling with retry
     - Refresh button
     - File selection callback
     - Responsive design
   - Styled with `FileBrowser.css`

## Integration Points

1. **Backend Registration** (in `interactive_server/main.py`):
   ```python
   workspace_handler = WorkspaceHandler(path_manager)
   HANDLERS.update(workspace_handler.get_methods())
   ```

2. **Frontend Usage** (in `frontend/src/App.tsx`):
   ```tsx
   <Route path="/files" element={
     <FileBrowser 
       jsonRpcService={jsonRpcService}
       onFileSelect={(filePath) => {
         console.log('File selected:', filePath);
       }}
     />
   } />
   ```

## API Example

Request:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "workspace.getTree",
  "params": { "path": "." },
  "id": 1
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "tree": "AIWhisperer\n├── ai_whisperer\n│   ├── agents\n│   └── ...",
    "path": ".",
    "type": "ascii"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations
- All file operations go through PathManager for security
- Directory access is restricted to workspace boundaries
- No direct file system access from frontend

## Future Enhancements
- Add file content preview
- Implement file search functionality  
- Add context menu for file operations
- Integrate with @ command system in chat
- Add file type icons
- Implement collapsible tree nodes
- Parse ASCII tree to make individual files clickable

## Testing
The implementation was tested with:
- Direct API testing using `test_workspace_api.py`
- Frontend integration testing
- Error handling scenarios

All components are working correctly and the file browser is accessible via the "/files" route in the frontend application.

## Original Planning Notes

### Existing Assets Used
- `build_ascii_directory_tree()` from `ai_whisperer/utils.py` - Already battle-tested
- WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
- JSON-RPC protocol established

### Migration Path Achieved
```
Planning → ASCII Display → [Future: Interactive ASCII → Full Tree UI]
(Day 0)     (Day 1)✅         (Week 1)              (Week 2-3)
```

We successfully implemented the first phase - getting a working ASCII tree display with minimal effort and maximum code reuse.
