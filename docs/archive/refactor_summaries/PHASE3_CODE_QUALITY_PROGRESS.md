# Phase 3: Code Quality and Standards - Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### 1. File Organization ✓
- Moved `ai_whisperer/commands/test_commands.py` to `tests/unit/commands/test_echo_status.py`
- Verified no circular dependencies exist in the codebase

### 2. Exception Hierarchy Enhancement ✓
- Enhanced `ai_whisperer/exceptions.py` with additional exception classes:
  - `ConfigurationError` (alias for ConfigError)
  - `ToolExecutionError` (extends TaskExecutionError)
  - `SessionError` (for session management)
  - `AgentError` (for agent-related errors)
- Exception hierarchy is now comprehensive and consistent

### 3. Type Annotations ✓
- Added type annotations to `ai_whisperer/tools/tool_usage_logging.py`
- Verified core modules already have proper type annotations:
  - `config.py` - fully typed
  - `base_tool.py` - fully typed
  - Most critical modules already have type hints

### 4. Code Quality Checks ✓
- Ran flake8 syntax check: **0 errors** (E9, F63, F7, F82)
- No undefined names or syntax errors in the codebase
- Identified 31 files with import organization issues

## Remaining Tasks

### Import Organization
Need to reorganize imports in 31 files to follow standard ordering:
1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports  
3. Local application imports

Key files to fix:
- `ai_whisperer/config.py`
- `ai_whisperer/cli.py`
- `ai_whisperer/cli_commands.py`
- `ai_whisperer/prompt_system.py`

### Documentation
- Add/update docstrings for public APIs
- Ensure consistent Google-style docstring format

### Code Formatting
- Install and run black formatter (not currently installed)
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks

## Summary

Phase 3 is progressing well with the core structural improvements completed:
- ✅ File organization corrected
- ✅ Exception hierarchy standardized
- ✅ Type annotations added where missing
- ✅ No syntax errors or undefined names
- ⏳ Import organization needs cleanup
- ⏳ Documentation improvements pending
- ⏳ Code formatting pending (black not installed)

The codebase is already in good shape with minimal critical issues. The remaining work is primarily cosmetic improvements for consistency.
