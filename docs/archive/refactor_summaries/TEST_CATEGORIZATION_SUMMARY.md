# Test Categorization Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive test categorization system to solve CI reliability issues and enable different levels of testing based on requirements.

## Test Categories

### 1. **unit** (122 files)
Fast, isolated unit tests with no external dependencies. Safe for CI.

### 2. **integration** (51 files)
Tests that integrate multiple components. Some safe for CI, others need network/API.

### 3. **slow** (13 files)
Tests that take significant time. Should skip in regular CI runs.

### 4. **network** (35 files)
Tests using sockets, websockets, or network connections. Often flaky in CI.

### 5. **requires_api** (72 files)
Tests needing API keys (OpenRouter). Cannot run without credentials.

### 6. **performance** (4 files)
Benchmarking and load tests. Run manually or in special CI jobs.

### 7. **ai_regression** (30 files + 17 scripts)
**NEW CATEGORY** - Tests using Debbie/batch runner to validate AI behavior:
- Catch regressions in AI responses
- Validate conversation flows
- Test model-specific behaviors
- Ensure prompts work as expected

## CI Configuration

### Default CI Run (Every PR/Push)
```bash
pytest -m "not (slow or network or requires_api or performance or ai_regression)"
```
- Runs ~413 tests
- Fast feedback (< 5 minutes)
- No flaky network tests
- No API dependencies

### Full Test Run (Manual/Scheduled)
```bash
pytest  # All tests
```
- Requires API keys in environment
- Takes 15-30 minutes
- Includes AI regression tests

## Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Fast feedback during development
pytest -m unit

# Test without API key
pytest -m "not requires_api"

# Run AI regression tests
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key pytest -m ai_regression

# Run specific AI regression script
python -m ai_whisperer.batch.batch_client scripts/test_continuation_feature.json
```

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Created `.github/workflows/tests.yml` with:

1. **Lint Job** - Runs on every PR
   - flake8 syntax check
   - black formatting check

2. **Unit Tests Job** - Runs on every PR
   - Only safe unit tests
   - Code coverage reporting

3. **Integration Tests Job** - Runs on push to main/develop
   - Integration tests without API
   - No slow or network tests

4. **Full Tests Job** - Manual trigger only
   - All tests including API
   - Requires environment secrets
   - For release validation

## Benefits

1. **Reliable CI** - No more random failures from network/async issues
2. **Fast Feedback** - PR checks complete in minutes, not hours
3. **AI Regression Testing** - Catch breaking changes in AI behavior
4. **Flexible Testing** - Different test levels for different needs
5. **Clear Categories** - Developers know which tests to run when

## Next Steps

1. Add pytest markers to existing test files
2. Create AI regression test scripts for critical workflows
3. Set up scheduled full test runs
4. Document AI regression test best practices
5. Monitor and refine categories based on usage

## Example AI Regression Test

```json
{
  "name": "Test RFC to Plan Conversion",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "@patricia create an RFC for adding dark mode"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "validation": {
        "expect_tool_calls": ["create_rfc"],
        "expect_in_content": ["dark mode", "RFC"]
      }
    },
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": "Convert this RFC to a plan"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "validation": {
        "expect_tool_calls": ["prepare_plan_from_rfc", "save_generated_plan"],
        "expect_valid_json": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This comprehensive test categorization system provides the foundation for reliable, efficient testing at all levels of the development lifecycle.
