## Debbie Usage Guide For Ai Assistants

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/DEBBIE_USAGE_GUIDE_FOR_AI_ASSISTANTS.md*

# Debbie the Debugger - Usage Guide for AI Coding Assistants

## What Debbie Does (and Doesn't Do)

**Debbie DOES:**
- 🔍 **Detect** issues like agent stalls, errors, and performance problems
- 📊 **Monitor** sessions in real-time with detailed metrics
- 💉 **Provide workarounds** by injecting messages to unstick agents
- 📝 **Generate insights** about what's happening and why
- 🎯 **Track patterns** to identify recurring issues

**Debbie DOES NOT:**
- ❌ Fix the underlying code that causes issues
- ❌ Permanently solve architectural problems
- ❌ Replace the need for proper debugging and fixes
- ❌ Automatically patch bugs in the codebase

## Case Study: How Debbie Detects Agent Stalls

### The Problem
Agents in AIWhisperer sometimes stall after executing tools. They complete the tool execution but then wait indefinitely for user input instead of continuing with their task.

### How Debbie Detects It

```python
# From monitoring.py - Stall Detection Logic
if (current_time - session.last_activity) > self.stall_threshold:
    # Check if last message was a tool result
    recent_messages = session.get_recent_messages(5)
    if recent_messages and recent_messages[-1].type == "tool_result":
        # This is likely a continuation stall
        alert = AnomalyAlert(
            alert_type="session_stall",
            severity="high",
            session_id=session_id,
            message="Agent stalled after tool execution",
            details={
                "last_tool": recent_messages[-1].tool_name,
                "stall_duration": stall_duration,
                "pattern": "continuation_stall"
            }
        )
```

### Reading Debbie's Output

When Debbie detects a stall, you'll see output like this:

```
[05:35:38] ⚠️ [DEBBIE] Stall detected! Agent inactive for >30s after tool use
            └─ pattern: continuation_stall
            └─ confidence: 95%
            └─ last_tool: list_rfcs
            └─ session_id: demo_session_1
[05:35:38] 💭 [DEBBIE] This is a common issue where agents wait for user input after tools
[05:35:38] 💉 [DEBBIE] Injecting continuation prompt for session demo_session_1
```

### Understanding the Debug Information

1. **Timing Information**: `[05:35:38]` - When the issue was detected
2. **Pattern Identification**: `continuation_stall` - Specific type of stall
3. **Context**: `last_tool: list_rfcs` - What the agent was doing
4. **Confidence**: How sure Debbie is about the pattern
5. **Action Taken**: Injection of continuation prompt (workaround)

## How to Use Debbie as an AI Assistant

### 1. Starting Debbie for a Debugging Session

```python
from ai_whisperer.batch.debbie_integration import DebbieFactory

# Create Debbie with appropriate settings
debbie = DebbieFactory.create_default()  # or create_aggressive() for faster detection
await debbie.start()

# Integrate with your batch client
batch_client = await integrate_debbie_with_batch_client(batch_client, debbie)
```

### 2. Running with Monitoring

```python
# Run your problematic code - Debbie monitors automatically
await batch_client.run()

# Debbie will detect issues and provide workarounds in real-time
```

### 3. Analyzing the Results

```python
# Get a comprehensive analysis
analysis = await debbie.analyze_session(session_id)

# Key information for debugging:
print(f"Stall count: {analysis['metrics']['stall_count']}")
print(f"Error count: {analysis['metrics']['error_count']}")
print(f"Interventions: {analysis['interventions']['count']}")
print(f"Recommendations: {analysis['recommendations']}")
```

### 4. Understanding Debbie's Insights

Debbie provides different types of insights:

#### Pattern Detection
```
[DEBBIE] Recurring error pattern detected
         └─ error_type: ConnectionTimeout
         └─ occurrences: 3
         └─ pattern: Identical errors on same endpoint
```
**What this tells you**: The same error is happening repeatedly, suggesting a systematic issue rather than a random failure.

#### Performance Analysis
```
[DEBBIE] Performance degradation detected!
         └─ current_avg: 520ms
         └─ baseline: 100ms
         └─ degradation: 5.2x slower
```
**What this tells you**: Something is causing the system to slow down over time - could be memory leak, resource exhaustion, or algorithmic issues.

#### Tool Loop Detection
```
[DEBBIE] Tool loop detected!
         └─ tool: search_files
         └─ executions: 7
         └─ pattern: Same parameters each time
```
**What this tells you**: An agent is stuck in a loop, repeatedly calling the same tool without making progress.

## Debugging Workflow with Debbie

### Step 1: Reproduce the Issue with Monitoring
```python
# Enable Debbie before running problematic code
debbie = DebbieFactory.create_aggressive()  # Fast detection
await debbie.start()
```

### Step 2: Let Debbie Detect and Work Around
- Debbie will automatically detect issues
- She'll apply workarounds to keep things running
- All actions are logged for analysis

### Step 3: Analyze the Root Cause
```python
# Get debugging report
report = debbie.get_debugging_report()

# Look for:
# - When issues occur (timing patterns)
# - What triggers them (specific tools/commands)
# - How often they happen (frequency)
# - What workarounds succeeded
```

### Step 4: Use Insights to Fix the Code
Based on Debbie's findings, you can:
1. Identify the specific code paths that cause stalls
2. Understand the conditions that trigger issues
3. See which workarounds are effective
4. Make informed decisions about permanent fixes

## Example: Using Debbie's Findings to Fix Code

### Debbie's Detection:
```
Multiple stalls detected after tool execution
Pattern: continuation_stall
Affected tools: list_rfcs, search_files, analyze_code
Workaround success rate: 100% with prompt injection
```

### What This Tells You:
1. The issue is systematic (affects multiple tools)
2. It's related to the continuation mechanism after tool execution
3. A simple prompt injection reliably works around it

### Potential Fixes to Investigate:
1. Check the agent's continuation logic after tool completion
2. Look for missing state updates after tool execution
3. Verify the message flow between tool completion and next action
4. Consider if the agent's prompt needs explicit continuation instructions

## Best Practices for AI Assistants Using Debbie

1. **Always Run Debbie During Development**
   - Helps catch issues early
   - Provides real-time feedback
   - Documents behavior patterns

2. **Use Aggressive Mode for Debugging**
   ```python
   debbie = DebbieFactory.create_aggressive()
   # Faster detection (2s vs 5s checks)
   # Lower thresholds (15s vs 30s for stalls)
   ```

3. **Review Intervention History**
   ```python
   # See what workarounds were needed
   history = debbie.orchestrator.executor.history.get_session_history(session_id)
   for intervention in history:
       print(f"{intervention.strategy}: {intervention.result}")
   ```

4. **Look for Patterns Across Sessions**
   - If the same issue appears repeatedly, it's systematic
   - If workarounds always succeed, the fix might be simple
   - If issues are random, might be race conditions or timing

## Interpreting Common Debbie Messages

### "Stall detected after tool execution"
**Means**: Agent completed a tool but didn't continue
**Investigate**: Continuation logic, state management, message flow

### "High error rate: 50%"
**Means**: Half of all operations are failing
**Investigate**: Error handling, retry logic, validation

### "Performance degraded to Xms"
**Means**: Operations taking longer than baseline
**Investigate**: Memory leaks, inefficient algorithms, resource contention

### "Tool loop detected"
**Means**: Same tool called repeatedly
**Investigate**: Loop conditions, exit criteria, state updates

## Future Capabilities (Coming Soon)

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Deeper investigation into why issues occur
- **Fix Suggestions**: Specific code changes to address issues
- **Historical Trends**: Pattern analysis across multiple sessions
- **Performance Profiling**: Detailed breakdowns of slow operations

---

Remember: Debbie is your debugging assistant. She helps you understand what's happening, provides temporary workarounds, and gives you the information needed to implement proper fixes. She's not a replacement for good debugging practices, but a powerful tool to make debugging more efficient and systematic.

## Debbie Implementation Complete

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/DEBBIE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md*

# Debbie the Debugger - Implementation Complete 🎉

## Overview
Successfully transformed Billy the Batcher into **Debbie the Debugger** - an intelligent debugging assistant for AIWhisperer that automatically detects issues, provides workarounds, and helps developers understand and fix problems in AI agent sessions.

## Key Problem Addressed
**Original Issue**: "Currently when our planning agent uses a tool it doesn't continue until the user types any message then it continues"

**What Debbie Does**: 
- **DETECTS** when agents stall after tool use (within 30 seconds)
- **IDENTIFIES** the pattern as a "continuation_stall"
- **PROVIDES A WORKAROUND** by injecting continuation prompts
- **LOGS** detailed information about when, where, and why the stall occurred
- **ENABLES DEVELOPERS** to understand the root cause and implement proper fixes

**Important**: Debbie doesn't fix the underlying code issue - she helps you debug it by providing visibility and temporary workarounds.

## Implementation Summary

## Debbie Phase3 Interactive Monitoring Design

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/DEBBIE_PHASE3_INTERACTIVE_MONITORING_DESIGN.md*

# Debbie Phase 3: Interactive Mode Monitoring Design

## Overview
Enable Debbie to observe and provide insights during live interactive sessions, helping developers and users debug issues in real-time without disrupting the user experience.

## Core Concept
Debbie becomes an optional "observer" that can be enabled for any interactive session. She watches the session, detects issues, and provides insights through a dedicated debugging channel - all without interfering with the normal user experience.

## Architecture

### 1. Non-Intrusive Integration
```python
# In interactive_server/main.py
if args.enable_debbie:
    debbie_observer = DebbieObserver(
        mode="passive",  # or "active" for interventions
        alert_threshold="medium"
    )
    session_manager.add_observer(debbie_observer)
```

### 2. Observation Points
- **WebSocket Messages**: All JSON-RPC traffic
- **Session State Changes**: Agent switches, context updates
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, memory usage
- **User Interactions**: Message frequency, command patterns
- **Tool Executions**: Success rates, durations, errors

### 3. Real-Time Insights Channel
```
User's Main Chat:                    Debbie's Debug Channel:
┌─────────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────────────┐

│                     │             │ 📊 Agent: Patricia       │
│ Patricia: I'll help │             │ ⏱️ Response time: 125ms  │
│ with that...        │             │                          │
│                     │ ────────>   │ ⚠️ Tool stall detected   │
│ [No response]       │             │ Pattern: continuation    │
│                     │             │ Suggestion: Refresh or   │
│                     │             │ type "continue"          │

## Debbie Fixes Summary

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/DEBBIE_FIXES_SUMMARY.md*

# Debbie "I am Gemini" Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Tool Registry in PromptSystem
**Problem**: The PromptSystem was initialized without a tool_registry, so `include_tools=True` had no effect.

**Fix Applied**: Modified `interactive_server/main.py` to pass tool_registry to PromptSystem:
```python
tool_registry = get_tool_registry()
prompt_system = PromptSystem(prompt_config, tool_registry)
```

### 2. ✅ Tool Instructions Not Included in System Prompt
**Problem**: Even when tools were available, Debbie didn't know how to use them because tool instructions weren't in her system prompt.

**Fix Applied**: Modified prompt loading in `stateless_session_manager.py` to:
- Prioritize PromptSystem over direct file read
- Set `include_tools=True` for debugging agents
- Add fallback that manually appends tool instructions

### 3. ⚠️ Circular Import Issue (Partial Fix)
**Problem**: Some debugging tools have circular imports when loaded from interactive_server.

**Current Status**: Tools are registered with try/except to handle import errors gracefully.

## Testing After Server Restart

1. **Restart the server** to apply all fixes:
   ```bash
   python -m interactive_server.main
   ```

2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Debbie should introduce herself as "Debbie, your intelligent debugging assistant"
   - NOT as "I am Gemini"
   - She should be able to use her debugging tools

3. **Test with the batch script**:
   ```
   python test_debbie_batch.py
   ```

## What Was Causing "I am Gemini"

The root cause was that Debbie's system prompt wasn't being properly set because:
1. The prompt was loaded without tool instructions
2. When the AI (Gemini model) didn't have a proper system prompt, it fell back to its default identity

With the fixes applied, Debbie should now have her full debugging persona AND knowledge of her tools!

## Verification Commands

After restarting, you can verify:
1. Check logs for: "PromptSystem initialized successfully with tool registry"
2. Check logs for: "Successfully loaded prompt via PromptSystem for d (tools included: True)"
3. Ask Debbie: "who are you?" - Should respond as Debbie, not Gemini
4. Ask Debbie: "what tools do you have?" - Should list her debugging tools

## Worktree Path Fix

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/WORKTREE_PATH_FIX.md*

# Worktree Path Resolution Fix

## Problem
When running AIWhisperer from a git worktree while using the main repository's virtual environment, the PathManager can get confused about which directory to use for built-in prompts. This causes agent prompts (like debbie_debugger.prompt.md) to not be found, falling back to the generic default.md.

## Root Cause
- The worktree is at: `/home/deano/projects/feature-billy-debugging-help`
- The main repo is at: `/home/deano/projects/AIWhisperer`
- Using venv from main repo: `/home/deano/projects/AIWhisperer/.venv`
- PathManager's app_path can resolve to the wrong location due to module loading paths

## Solutions

### 1. Use Worktree-Specific Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/deano/projects/feature-billy-debugging-help
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m interactive_server.main
```

### 2. Clear Python Path Before Starting
```bash
cd /home/deano/projects/feature-billy-debugging-help
unset PYTHONPATH
/home/deano/projects/AIWhisperer/.venv/bin/python -m interactive_server.main
```

### 3. Force Correct Path in Server Startup
Add this to the beginning of `interactive_server/main.py`:
```python
import sys
import os
# Ensure we're using modules from the current directory
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_root = os.path.dirname(current_dir)
if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_root)
```

## Verification
After applying the fix, when you switch to Debbie, she should introduce herself with:
- Her name "Debbie the Debugger"
- The 🐛 emoji
- Her dual roles of debugging and batch processing
- Not the generic "I am an AI assistant" message

## Tool Calling Implementation Summary

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/TOOL_CALLING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md*

# Tool Calling Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented OpenRouter/OpenAI standard tool calling system for AIWhisperer, enabling agents like Debbie the Debugger to use their specialized tools through the AI service.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Tool Call Accumulation Issue**: Fixed critical bug where streaming tool calls were being concatenated as JSON strings instead of properly accumulated as objects
2. **Tool Registration**: Ensured Debbie's debugging tools are properly registered in the interactive server
3. **Tool Definition Format**: Fixed tool definitions to match OpenAI/OpenRouter standards with proper `additionalProperties: false`

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Tool Call Accumulator (`ai_whisperer/ai_loop/tool_call_accumulator.py`)
- Properly handles streaming tool call chunks
- Accumulates partial tool calls into complete tool call objects
- Prevents JSON string concatenation issues

### 2. Debbie's Debugging Tools
- **session_health_tool.py**: Monitors session health with metrics and scores
- **session_analysis_tool.py**: Deep analysis of errors and performance
- **monitoring_control_tool.py**: Controls monitoring settings and alerts

### 3. Tool Calling Handler (`ai_whisperer/ai_service/tool_calling.py`)
- Implements OpenAI/OpenRouter tool calling standards
- Handles tool execution and message formatting
- Supports both single-tool and multi-tool models

### 4. Integration Updates
- Modified `stateless_ai_loop.py` to use ToolCallAccumulator
- Updated tool registry to handle dynamic tool registration
- Fixed tool execution patterns to support different calling conventions

## Test Results
All three of Debbie's debugging tools successfully tested:
```
✅ PASS: session_health tool executed successfully
✅ PASS: session_analysis tool executed successfully  
✅ PASS: monitoring_control tool executed successfully
✅ AI successfully used tools: ['session_health']
```

## Technical Details

### Tool Message Format
```python
{
    "role": "tool",
    "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
    "content": "Tool result here"
}
```

### Tool Call Structure
```python
{
    "id": "toolu_01234",
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "session_health",
        "arguments": "{\"session_id\": \"current\"}"
    }
}
```

### Key Discovery
The agent tool set system already handles automatic tool registration via YAML configuration. Debbie has `tool_sets: ["debugging_tools", "monitoring_tools"]` configured, which automatically loads her tools when she's active.

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Create batch tests for regression testing across different models
2. Test with Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4 to verify multi-model compatibility
3. Enhance tool calling with strict mode for structured outputs
4. Add tool choice parameters (auto, required, specific function)

## Summary
The implementation successfully gives AIWhisperer agents the ability to use tools following the OpenAI/OpenRouter standards. Debbie can now use her debugging tools through Claude, completing the original request to ensure "Debbie using claude use its own session tools".

## Chat Bug Root Cause

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/CHAT_BUG_ROOT_CAUSE.md*

# Chat Bug Root Cause Analysis

## Summary
The chat bug has TWO distinct issues:
1. **Empty Response Issue**: Certain messages receive empty responses (`response_length=0`)
2. **Message Buffering**: The empty response causes the next message to act as a "flush"

## Root Cause
When the AI receives certain message patterns, it returns an empty response. This creates a cascading effect:

1. User sends "What agents are available?"
2. AI returns empty response (0 chars)
3. Context now has two consecutive user messages with no assistant response between
4. User sends "ok" 
5. AI sees the broken context and answers the previous question instead

## Evidence from Logs

### Normal Flow (Message 1):
```
🚨 SENDING TO AI: 2 messages
🚨 MSG[0] role=system content=You are Alice...
🚨 MSG[1] role=user content=Hello can you tell me about AIWhisperer?
🔄 STREAM FINISHED: response_length=1938
```

### Broken Flow (Message 2):
```
🚨 SENDING TO AI: 4 messages
🚨 MSG[0] role=system content=You are Alice...
🚨 MSG[1] role=user content=Hello can you tell me about AIWhisperer?
🚨 MSG[2] role=assistant content=Hello! Welcome to AIWhisperer...
🚨 MSG[3] role=user content=What agents are available to help me?
🔄 STREAM FINISHED: response_length=0  ❌ EMPTY!
```

### Cascading Effect (Message 3):
```
🚨 SENDING TO AI: 5 messages
🚨 MSG[0] role=system content=You are Alice...
🚨 MSG[1] role=user content=Hello can you tell me about AIWhisperer?
🚨 MSG[2] role=assistant content=Hello! Welcome to AIWhisperer...
🚨 MSG[3] role=user content=What agents are available to help me?
🚨 MSG[4] role=user content=ok  ❌ Two consecutive user messages!
🔄 STREAM FINISHED: response_length=2201  (Answers the agents question)
```

## Why This Happens
The AI is returning empty responses for certain queries. This could be due to:
1. Model-specific behavior when it sees certain patterns
2. Timeout or streaming issues causing premature completion
3. The AI service returning an error that's being swallowed

## The Pattern
- Message 1: Works ✅
- Message 2: Empty response ❌
- Message 3: Answers previous question ❌
- Message 4: Empty response ❌
- Message 5: Would answer message 4 ❌

## Fix Strategy
We need to:
1. Investigate why the AI returns empty responses
2. Add defensive handling for empty responses
3. Possibly retry when we get an empty response
4. Ensure proper error handling in the streaming mechanism

## Reasoning Token Implementation

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/REASONING_TOKEN_IMPLEMENTATION.md*

# Reasoning Token Implementation

## Problem
The model `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` was returning empty responses with only 3 chunks when processing certain message sequences. Investigation revealed this was due to the model outputting reasoning tokens that weren't being captured.

## Root Cause
OpenRouter supports reasoning tokens for certain models. When a model outputs reasoning tokens but the code doesn't handle them, the response appears empty because:
- Reasoning tokens appear in `delta.reasoning` not `delta.content`
- Our code was only looking at `delta.content`
- The 3-chunk pattern was: initialization, reasoning output, finish

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Extended AIStreamChunk
Added `delta_reasoning` field to capture reasoning tokens:
```python
class AIStreamChunk:
    def __init__(self, delta_content=None, delta_tool_call_part=None, 
                 finish_reason=None, delta_reasoning=None):
        self.delta_reasoning = delta_reasoning  # New field
```

### 2. Updated OpenRouter Service
Extract reasoning from the delta:
```python
delta_reasoning = delta.get("reasoning")  # Extract reasoning tokens
yield AIStreamChunk(
    delta_content=delta_content,
    delta_reasoning=delta_reasoning,
    ...
)
```

### 3. Enhanced AI Loop
- Accumulate reasoning tokens separately: `full_reasoning = ""`
- Stream reasoning tokens to maintain backward compatibility
- Return reasoning in the result dict
- Handle reasoning-only responses (no content but has reasoning)

### 4. Context Storage
Store reasoning in assistant messages:
```python
if response_data.get('reasoning'):
    assistant_message['reasoning'] = response_data['reasoning']
```

## Behavior

### When Model Outputs Reasoning Only
- Reasoning is accumulated and returned in the `reasoning` field
- For backward compatibility, reasoning is also used as `content` 
- Context stores both fields to preserve full information

### Empty Response Handling
- Empty means no content AND no reasoning
- If we have reasoning but no content, that's valid
- Retry logic only triggers for truly empty responses

## Benefits
1. **Proper Model Support**: Works with all OpenRouter reasoning models
2. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work
3. **Transparent**: Reasoning is available for debugging/analysis
4. **Flexible**: Can later add UI to show/hide reasoning

## Future Enhancements
1. Add UI toggle to show/hide reasoning tokens
2. Support reasoning configuration (effort levels, token limits)
3. Separate reasoning from content in the UI
4. Add reasoning-specific formatting

## Testing
Run `test_reasoning_tokens.py` to verify:
- Reasoning tokens are captured
- Context integrity is maintained
- No more empty responses for reasoning models
- Backward compatibility with non-reasoning models

## Technical Approach

### 1. Non-Intrusive Observation
```python
class DebbieObserver:
    def __init__(self, session_manager):
        self.session_manager = session_manager
        self.monitors = {}
        self._register_hooks()
    
    def _register_hooks(self):
        # Hook into session lifecycle
        self.session_manager.on_message = self._wrap_message_handler
        self.session_manager.on_tool_execution = self._wrap_tool_handler
    
    def observe_session(self, session_id: str):
        if session_id not in self.monitors:
            self.monitors[session_id] = InteractiveMonitor(session_id)
```

### 2. Pattern Detection
```python
class PatternDetector:
    PATTERNS = {
        'rapid_retry': {
            'threshold': 3,
            'window': 10,  # seconds
            'description': 'User retrying same command'
        },
        'tool_timeout': {
            'threshold': 30,  # seconds
            'description': 'Tool execution taking too long'
        },
        'error_cascade': {
            'threshold': 5,
            'window': 60,  # seconds
            'description': 'Multiple errors in succession'
        }
    }
```

### 3. Real-time Alerts
```python
class AlertSystem:
    def __init__(self, websocket_manager):
        self.ws_manager = websocket_manager
        self.alert_queue = asyncio.Queue()
    
    async def send_alert(self, session_id: str, alert: Alert):
        await self.ws_manager.send_notification(
            session_id,
            {
                'type': 'debbie_alert',
                'severity': alert.severity,
                'message': alert.message,
                'suggestions': alert.suggestions
            }
        )
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Session Manager Hooks
- `before_message_processing`

- User-controlled monitoring levels

### 3. Scalability
- Per-session resource limits
- Automatic cleanup of idle monitors
- Configurable monitoring depth

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Stall Detection
```
User: "List all files in the project"
[30 seconds pass with no response]
Debbie Alert: "Agent appears to be processing. This is taking longer than usual. 
Consider checking the workspace size or trying a more specific path."
```

### 2. Error Pattern Recognition
```
User: "Create file test.py"
Error: Permission denied
User: "Create test.py"
Error: Permission denied
Debbie Alert: "Permission issues detected. Try:
1. Check your output directory permissions
2. Use a different directory
3. Run with appropriate permissions"
```

### 3. Frustration Detection
```
[User sends 5 similar messages in 30 seconds]
Debbie Alert: "Having trouble? Here are some suggestions:
1. Try rephrasing your request
2. Check the agent's capabilities with /help
3. View recent errors with /debbie analyze"
```

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve design
2. Set up development environment
3. Create test harness for observer
4. Begin Day 1 implementation

## Worktree Setup

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/WORKTREE_SETUP.md*

# Git Worktree Setup Guide for AIWhisperer

## Why This Matters

When working with git worktrees, Python module resolution can get confused, especially when:
- Using a shared virtual environment from the main repository
- The main repo and worktree have different versions of files
- Agent prompt files exist in one location but not another

## Current Setup

- Main repository: `/home/deano/projects/AIWhisperer`
- This worktree: `/home/deano/projects/feature-billy-debugging-help`
- Shared venv: `/home/deano/projects/AIWhisperer/.venv`

## The Path Resolution Issue

When using the main repo's venv while running from a worktree:
1. Python's module import system might load modules from unexpected locations
2. PathManager's `app_path` (based on `__file__`) can resolve incorrectly
3. Prompt files might be looked up in the wrong directory
4. Agent-specific prompts (like debbie_debugger.prompt.md) might not be found

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Path Priority Fix (main.py)
Added code to ensure the worktree's modules are loaded first:
```python
# Ensure we're using modules from the current worktree directory
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_root = os.path.dirname(current_dir)
if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_root)
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- PathManager now logs all paths it's using
- Prompt resolution logs all attempted paths when falling back
- Server startup shows which prompts are found

### 3. Better Fallback Prompt
The default.md now clearly indicates when it's being used as a fallback, helping identify path issues immediately.

## Recommended Workflows

### Option 1: Worktree-Specific Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# One-time setup
./setup_worktree_venv.sh

# Start server
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m interactive_server.main
```

**Pros:**
- Complete isolation between branches
- No path confusion
- Can have different dependencies per branch

**Cons:**
- Uses more disk space
- Need to install dependencies for each worktree

### Option 2: Shared venv with Path Management
```bash
# Start server with path management
./start_server.sh
```

**Pros:**
- Saves disk space
- Faster to switch between worktrees

**Cons:**
- Potential path confusion
- Dependencies must be compatible across all branches

### Option 3: Manual Path Control
```bash
cd /home/deano/projects/feature-billy-debugging-help
unset PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH"
python -m interactive_server.main
```

## Verifying Correct Setup

After starting the server, check the logs for:
1. "Project root: /home/deano/projects/feature-billy-debugging-help"
2. "✓ Debbie's prompt file found"
3. No warnings about fallback prompts

When switching to Debbie, she should introduce herself as "Debbie the Debugger" with the 🐛 emoji, not as a generic AI assistant.

## Troubleshooting

If prompts are still not found:
1. Check the server startup logs for PathManager paths
2. Look for "FALLBACK" warnings in the logs
3. Verify prompt files exist: `ls prompts/agents/`
4. Check Python module locations: `python -c "import ai_whisperer; print(ai_whisperer.__file__)"`

## Design Philosophy

The prompt loading system is designed with these priorities:
1. **Customization**: Users can override built-in prompts by placing custom versions in their project
2. **Fallback**: Built-in prompts in app_path serve as reliable defaults
3. **Transparency**: Clear logging and error messages when prompts can't be found
4. **Safety**: A generic fallback prompt ensures the system still works even if specific prompts are missing

This allows technical users to customize agent behavior while maintaining a working system out of the box.

## Debbie Introduction Fix

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/DEBBIE_INTRODUCTION_FIX.md*

# Debbie Introduction Fix

## Issue
When switching to Debbie (agent 'd'), she was giving a generic introduction instead of her personality-filled introduction mentioning her name and debugging capabilities.

## Root Cause
The `_create_agent_internal` method was being called with incorrect parameters. The code was passing `agent_registry_info` as a positional argument in the third position, but the method signature expects:
1. `agent_id` (str)
2. `system_prompt` (str) 
3. `config` (Optional[AgentConfig])
4. `agent_registry_info` (optional keyword argument)

This caused the `agent_registry_info` to be interpreted as `config`, breaking the agent creation flow.

## Fix Applied
Changed line 394 in `interactive_server/stateless_session_manager.py`:

```python
# Before (incorrect):
await self._create_agent_internal(agent_id, system_prompt, agent_registry_info=agent_info)

# After (correct):
await self._create_agent_internal(agent_id, system_prompt, config=None, agent_registry_info=agent_info)
```

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Restart the interactive server
2. Start a new session
3. Switch to Debbie with `session.switch_agent` with `agent_id: "d"`
4. Debbie should now introduce herself with her personality:
   - Mentioning her name "Debbie" 
   - Describing her debugging and batch processing roles
   - Using the 🐛 emoji
   - Showing her analytical and proactive personality

## Impact
This fix ensures that all agents loaded from the registry (Patricia, Alice, Tessa, Debbie) will have their proper system prompts loaded and will introduce themselves correctly, rather than falling back to a generic AI assistant persona.

## Websocket Session Fix Summary

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/WEBSOCKET_SESSION_FIX_SUMMARY.md*

# WebSocket Session Management Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The root cause of the chat buffering and persona loss was **orphaned WebSocket sessions** caused by:
1. Browser windows being closed abruptly (as you discovered!)
2. No cleanup when WebSocket connections disconnect
3. AI responses continuing to stream to closed connections
4. Empty responses not being stored to context, causing consecutive user messages

## Symptoms
1. Messages require a "flush" message to appear (buffering effect)
2. Alice loses her persona after initial messages
3. Empty responses (`response_length=0`) in logs
4. "Cannot call 'send' once a close message has been sent" errors

## Root Cause Analysis
When a browser window closes:
- The WebSocket connection terminates
- The server doesn't clean up the session association
- The AI continues streaming responses to the closed WebSocket
- This results in empty responses being returned
- Empty responses aren't stored to context, creating invalid message sequences
- The next message sees two consecutive user messages and loses context

## Fixes Applied

### 1. WebSocket Cleanup (`interactive_server/main.py`)
Added cleanup when WebSocket connections close:
```python
# Cleanup session when WebSocket closes
try:
    if websocket in session_manager.websocket_sessions:
        session_id = session_manager.websocket_sessions[websocket]
        # Remove the WebSocket association
        del session_manager.websocket_sessions[websocket]
        # Clear the WebSocket reference in the session
        if session_id in session_manager.sessions:
            session = session_manager.sessions[session_id]
            session.websocket = None
```

### 2. Safe Streaming (`interactive_server/stateless_session_manager.py`)
Added checks before sending to WebSocket:
```python
# Check if WebSocket is still connected
if self.websocket is None:
    logger.warning(f"WebSocket disconnected for session {session_id}, skipping chunk")
    return
```

### 3. Context Integrity (`ai_whisperer/ai_loop/stateless_ai_loop.py`)
Always store assistant messages to prevent consecutive user messages:
```python
# Empty response - store a placeholder to maintain context integrity
if not response_data.get('response') and not response_data.get('tool_calls'):
    logger.warning(f"Empty response detected, storing placeholder to maintain context")
    assistant_message['content'] = "[Assistant response unavailable due to connection interruption]"
```

## Testing
Created `test_session_cleanup.py` to verify:
1. Abrupt disconnection handling
2. Session persistence after reconnect
3. Context preservation

## Recommendations
1. Always close browser tabs properly when done
2. Consider implementing session timeouts
3. Add reconnection handling in the frontend
4. Monitor for orphaned sessions periodically

The fixes ensure that:
- Sessions are properly cleaned up when connections close
- AI responses don't try to stream to closed connections
- Context integrity is maintained even with connection issues
- Alice (and other agents) maintain their personas across disconnections

## Debbie Enhanced Logging Design

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/DEBBIE_ENHANCED_LOGGING_DESIGN.md*

# Debbie's Enhanced Logging & Python Execution Design

## Overview

Debbie requires sophisticated multi-source logging to effectively debug AIWhisperer sessions. This design enhances the existing logging system to support:
- Multi-source log aggregation with clear source identification
- Real-time log streaming and analysis
- Debbie's commentary and insights
- Python script execution for advanced debugging

## Enhanced Logging Architecture

### 1. Multi-Source Log Management

```python
class LogSource(Enum):
    DEBBIE = "debbie"              # Debbie's own operations
    DEBBIE_COMMENT = "debbie_comment"  # Debbie's debugging insights
    SERVER = "server"            # Interactive server
    AGENT = "agent"              # Agent operations
    AI_SERVICE = "ai_service"    # AI model interactions
    TOOL = "tool"                # Tool executions
    SESSION = "session"          # Session management
    WEBSOCKET = "websocket"      # WebSocket messages
    USER_SCRIPT = "user_script"  # User's batch script
    PYTHON_EXEC = "python_exec"  # Python script execution

@dataclass
class EnhancedLogMessage(LogMessage):
    """Extended log message with debugging context"""
    source: LogSource
    session_id: Optional[str] = None
    agent_id: Optional[str] = None
    correlation_id: Optional[str] = None  # Links related events
    parent_id: Optional[str] = None       # For nested operations
    tags: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    performance_metrics: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
    stack_trace: Optional[str] = None
    context_snapshot: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

### 2. Debbie's Commentary System

```python
class DebbieCommentary:
    """Debbie's intelligent logging commentary"""
    
    def __init__(self, logger: DebbieLogger):
        self.logger = logger
        self.pattern_detector = PatternDetector()
        self.insight_generator = InsightGenerator()
    
    def observe(self, event: LogEvent):
        """Analyze event and potentially add commentary"""
        # Detect patterns
        patterns = self.pattern_detector.analyze(event)
        
        if patterns:
            insight = self.insight_generator.generate(event, patterns)
            self.logger.comment(
                level=LogLevel.INFO,
                comment=insight.message,
                context={

                }
            )
    
    def explain_stall(self, session_id: str, duration: float):
        """Explain why a session stalled"""
        self.logger.comment(
            level=LogLevel.WARNING,
            comment=f"Session stalled for {duration}s. Agent appears to be waiting for user input after tool execution. This is a known continuation issue.",
            context={

                "suggested_action": "inject_continuation_prompt"
            }
        )
```

### 3. Log Aggregation & Correlation

```python
class LogAggregator:
    """Aggregates logs from multiple sources with correlation"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.streams = {}
        self.correlation_map = {}
        self.timeline = TimelineBuilder()
    
    def add_log(self, log: EnhancedLogMessage):
        """Add log maintaining correlations"""
        # Group by correlation ID
        if log.correlation_id:
            self.correlation_map[log.correlation_id].append(log)
        
        # Build timeline
        self.timeline.add_event(log)
        
        # Stream to appropriate handlers
        self._stream_to_handlers(log)
    
    def get_correlated_logs(self, correlation_id: str) -> List[EnhancedLogMessage]:
        """Get all logs related to a correlation ID"""
        return self.correlation_map.get(correlation_id, [])
    
    def get_session_timeline(self, session_id: str) -> Timeline:
        """Get complete timeline for a session"""
        return self.timeline.build_for_session(session_id)
```

### 4. Real-Time Log Streaming

```python
class LogStreamer:
    """Streams logs in real-time with filtering"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.filters = []
        self.subscribers = []
        self.buffer = CircularBuffer(10000)  # Keep last 10k entries
    
    async def stream(self, filter_spec: Dict[str, Any]) -> AsyncIterator[EnhancedLogMessage]:
        """Stream logs matching filter"""
        async for log in self._tail_logs():
            if self._matches_filter(log, filter_spec):
                yield log
    
    def add_alert(self, condition: Callable, action: Callable):
        """Add real-time alert on log condition"""
        self.alerts.append((condition, action))
```

[2025-05-29 10:15:32.123] [debbie_comment] [INFO] [debugging] Detected stall pattern: Agent Patricia waiting for user input after listing RFCs. Duration: 45.2s | {"pattern": "tool_execution_stall", "confidence": 0.92}

[2025-05-29 10:15:33.456] [debbie] [INFO] [intervention] Injecting continuation prompt to unstick agent | {"session_id": "abc123", "agent_id": "p", "injection_type": "continuation"}

[2025-05-29 10:15:35.789] [debbie_comment] [INFO] [debugging] Intervention successful! Agent resumed processing. Response time: 2.3s | {"resolution": "automatic", "time_to_resolve": 2.333}
```

### Debbie Executes Debugging Script
```python
# Debbie writes and executes analysis script
await python_executor.execute("""
# Analyze why agent is slow
import pandas as pd

# Group logs by operation
ops = pd.DataFrame([log.to_dict() for log in logs])
slow_ops = ops[ops['duration_ms'] > 5000]

print(f"Found {len(slow_ops)} slow operations:")
print(slow_ops[['action', 'duration_ms', 'component']].sort_values('duration_ms', ascending=False))

# Check for patterns
if 'websocket' in slow_ops['component'].values:
    print("\\n⚠️ WebSocket communication is slow - check network latency")
""")
```

This enhanced logging system gives Debbie powerful debugging capabilities through structured multi-source logging, intelligent commentary, and Python script execution for advanced analysis.

## Legacy Cleanup Summary

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/LEGACY_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md*

# Legacy Code Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Removing legacy planning and execution modules that are no longer used in the modern interactive/batch architecture.

## Modules Being Removed

### Core Legacy Modules
- `ai_whisperer/execution_engine.py` - Old execution system
- `ai_whisperer/initial_plan_generator.py` - Legacy plan generation
- `ai_whisperer/plan_runner.py` - Old plan execution runner
- `ai_whisperer/project_plan_generator.py` - Legacy project planning
- `ai_whisperer/subtask_generator.py` - Old subtask generation system

### Agent Handlers (Old Architecture)
- `ai_whisperer/agent_handlers/` - Entire directory of old handlers

### Legacy Tests
- `tests/unit/test_subtask_generator.py` - Tests for removed module
- Various other tests that fail due to missing legacy modules

## Rationale
- The codebase has evolved to use interactive (WebSocket/React) and batch mode architectures
- These legacy modules are from the old CLI-based planning system
- Neither interactive server nor batch mode use any of these modules
- Removing them will:
  - Reduce maintenance burden
  - Eliminate failing tests for unused code
  - Make the codebase cleaner and easier to understand
  - Focus development on the current architecture

## Migration Path
- Interactive mode: Uses stateless agents and WebSocket communication
- Batch mode: Uses script-based execution with monitoring
- Both modes are fully functional without these legacy modules

## Git History
All removed code remains accessible in git history for reference if needed.

## Buffering Bug Fix Summary

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/BUFFERING_BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md*

# Message Buffering Bug Fix Summary

## Original Bug Description
1. After sending the first message, users had to send a "flush" message to get the reply to the previous message
2. Alice would lose her persona/system message after initial messages

## Root Cause
The server was treating `sendUserMessage` calls without JSON-RPC IDs as notifications and completely ignoring them. The code in `handle_websocket_message` would return `None` for notifications without processing them.

## Fix Applied
Modified `interactive_server/main.py` in the `handle_websocket_message` function (lines 639-657) to:

```python
else:
    # Notification - still process certain critical methods
    method = msg.get("method", "")
    if method in ["sendUserMessage", "provideToolResult"]:
        # These methods should be processed even as notifications
        # to prevent message buffering issues
        logging.warning(f"[handle_websocket_message] Processing critical notification: {method}")
        try:
            # Create a fake ID for internal processing
            msg["id"] = f"notification_{method}_{id(msg)}"
            response = await process_json_rpc_request(msg, websocket)
            # Don't return the response for notifications
            return None
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"[handle_websocket_message] Error processing notification: {e}")
            return None
    else:
        # Other notifications - do nothing
        return None
```

## Test Results
Created test scripts that confirmed:
1. ✅ All messages now receive responses without needing a flush message
2. ✅ Alice maintains her identity throughout the conversation
3. ✅ System prompts are preserved correctly (verified with context tracing)

## Key Insights
- The frontend sometimes sends messages as notifications (without IDs)
- Critical methods like `sendUserMessage` should be processed regardless of whether they have an ID
- The fix ensures backward compatibility while solving the buffering issue

## Openrouter Service Simplification Complete

*Original file: docs/debugging-session-2025-05-30/OPENROUTER_SERVICE_SIMPLIFICATION_COMPLETE.md*

# OpenRouter Service Simplification Complete

## Summary

The OpenRouter AI service has been successfully simplified to fix critical bugs that were causing:
1. Messages requiring a "flush" message to appear
2. Alice losing her persona/system message

## Root Cause

The old OpenRouter service had complex message handling that:
- Split messages into `prompt_text`, `system_prompt`, and `messages_history`
- Stripped system messages from the message history
- Had inconsistent parameter handling between streaming and non-streaming paths
- Did not include `max_tokens` and other parameters consistently

## Solution

Created a simplified OpenRouter service that:
- Passes messages directly to the API without manipulation
- Consistently includes all parameters in every API call
- Maintains message integrity (system prompts stay intact)
- Uses the same code path for all requests

## Changes Made

1. **Created simplified service** (`openrouter_ai_service_simplified.py`)
   - Direct message passing
   - Consistent parameter handling
   - Clean, maintainable code

2. **Tested and verified** the simplified service works correctly
   - Test showed 112 chunks with content vs 3 chunks with no content

3. **Replaced the old service**
   - Backed up old service as `openrouter_ai_service_old.py`
   - Renamed simplified service to `openrouter_ai_service.py`
   - Updated class name from `SimplifiedOpenRouterAIService` to `OpenRouterAIService`

4. **Verified integration**
   - All imports throughout codebase now use the simplified service
   - No references to old service names remain (except in test file)
   - Service instantiates and works correctly

## Impact

- Alice and other agents now maintain their personas correctly
- Messages appear immediately without requiring a flush
- Consistent behavior across all API calls
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Test Results

Before simplification:
- 3 chunks received
- 0 characters of content
- System message lost

After simplification:
- 112 chunks received  
- 1063 characters of content
- System message preserved

The critical bugs have been resolved! 🎉
