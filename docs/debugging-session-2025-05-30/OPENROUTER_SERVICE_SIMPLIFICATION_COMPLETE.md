# OpenRouter Service Simplification Complete

## Summary

The OpenRouter AI service has been successfully simplified to fix critical bugs that were causing:
1. Messages requiring a "flush" message to appear
2. Alice losing her persona/system message

## Root Cause

The old OpenRouter service had complex message handling that:
- Split messages into `prompt_text`, `system_prompt`, and `messages_history`
- Stripped system messages from the message history
- Had inconsistent parameter handling between streaming and non-streaming paths
- Did not include `max_tokens` and other parameters consistently

## Solution

Created a simplified OpenRouter service that:
- Passes messages directly to the API without manipulation
- Consistently includes all parameters in every API call
- Maintains message integrity (system prompts stay intact)
- Uses the same code path for all requests

## Changes Made

1. **Created simplified service** (`openrouter_ai_service_simplified.py`)
   - Direct message passing
   - Consistent parameter handling
   - Clean, maintainable code

2. **Tested and verified** the simplified service works correctly
   - Test showed 112 chunks with content vs 3 chunks with no content

3. **Replaced the old service**
   - Backed up old service as `openrouter_ai_service_old.py`
   - Renamed simplified service to `openrouter_ai_service.py`
   - Updated class name from `SimplifiedOpenRouterAIService` to `OpenRouterAIService`

4. **Verified integration**
   - All imports throughout codebase now use the simplified service
   - No references to old service names remain (except in test file)
   - Service instantiates and works correctly

## Impact

- Alice and other agents now maintain their personas correctly
- Messages appear immediately without requiring a flush
- Consistent behavior across all API calls
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Test Results

Before simplification:
- 3 chunks received
- 0 characters of content
- System message lost

After simplification:
- 112 chunks received  
- 1063 characters of content
- System message preserved
