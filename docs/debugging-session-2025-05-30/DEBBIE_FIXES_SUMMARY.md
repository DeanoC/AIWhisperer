# Debbie "I am Gemini" Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Tool Registry in PromptSystem
**Problem**: The PromptSystem was initialized without a tool_registry, so `include_tools=True` had no effect.

**Fix Applied**: Modified `interactive_server/main.py` to pass tool_registry to PromptSystem:
```python
tool_registry = get_tool_registry()
prompt_system = PromptSystem(prompt_config, tool_registry)
```

### 2. ✅ Tool Instructions Not Included in System Prompt
**Problem**: Even when tools were available, Debbie didn't know how to use them because tool instructions weren't in her system prompt.

**Fix Applied**: Modified prompt loading in `stateless_session_manager.py` to:
- Prioritize PromptSystem over direct file read
- Set `include_tools=True` for debugging agents
- Add fallback that manually appends tool instructions

### 3. ⚠️ Circular Import Issue (Partial Fix)
**Problem**: Some debugging tools have circular imports when loaded from interactive_server.

**Current Status**: Tools are registered with try/except to handle import errors gracefully.

## Testing After Server Restart

1. **Restart the server** to apply all fixes:
   ```bash
   python -m interactive_server.main
   ```

2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Debbie should introduce herself as "Debbie, your intelligent debugging assistant"
   - NOT as "I am Gemini"
   - She should be able to use her debugging tools

3. **Test with the batch script**:
   ```
   python test_debbie_batch.py
   ```

## What Was Causing "I am Gemini"

The root cause was that Debbie's system prompt wasn't being properly set because:
1. The prompt was loaded without tool instructions
2. When the AI (Gemini model) didn't have a proper system prompt, it fell back to its default identity

With the fixes applied, Debbie should now have her full debugging persona AND knowledge of her tools!

## Verification Commands

After restarting, you can verify:
1. Check logs for: "PromptSystem initialized successfully with tool registry"
2. Check logs for: "Successfully loaded prompt via PromptSystem for d (tools included: True)"
3. Ask Debbie: "who are you?" - Should respond as Debbie, not Gemini
4. Ask Debbie: "what tools do you have?" - Should list her debugging tools
