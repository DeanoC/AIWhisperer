# Per-Agent AI Loops Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phases 1 & 2 of the per-agent AI loops feature from the "Async Multi-Agent Workflows" initiative. This foundational work enables each agent to use different AI models based on their specific needs.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **AILoopFactory**: Created factory pattern for instantiating AI loops with different configurations
- **AILoopManager**: Implemented manager to handle per-agent AI loop instances with lazy creation
- **AILoopConfig**: Designed configuration dataclass that integrates with AgentConfig

### 2. Agent System Integration
- Modified `StatelessSessionManager` to use `AILoopManager` instead of a single global AI loop
- Updated `Agent` dataclass to support `ai_config` field
- Enhanced agent configuration loading to support model-specific settings

### 3. Bug Fixes
- **Patricia**: Fixed issue where she would use tools without providing explanatory text
- **Alice**: Resolved inability to switch agents by creating `SwitchAgentTool`

### 4. Testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests for `AILoopFactory` and `AILoopManager`
- Fixed mocking issues related to type-checked `OpenRouterAIService`
- All tests pass successfully

## Configuration Examples

### Agent-Specific Models (config/agents/agents.yaml)
```yaml
agents:
  - id: "D"
    name: "Debbie"
    ai_config:
      model: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
      generation_params:
        temperature: 0.5
        max_tokens: 4000

  - id: "E"
    name: "Eamonn"
    ai_config:
      model: "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
      generation_params:
        temperature: 0.7
        max_tokens: 8000
```

## Architecture Benefits
1. **Flexibility**: Each agent can use the most appropriate model for their tasks
2. **Cost Optimization**: Use cheaper models for simple tasks, premium models for complex ones
3. **Specialization**: Agents can be tuned with model-specific parameters
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new AI providers in the future

## Testing Results
- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests confirm continuation functionality works
- WebSocket stress tests marked as skip to avoid overloading dev machines

## Next Steps (Phase 3 - Future Work)
- Implement concurrent AI loop execution for parallel agent processing
- Add request queuing and load balancing
- Implement proper resource management and cleanup
- Add performance monitoring and metrics

## Known Issues
- System prompts are loaded correctly but Gemini's response style can be confusing
- WebSocket stress tests can overload local development machines
