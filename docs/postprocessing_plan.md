# Postprocessing Plan for YAML Cleanup

## Overview
This document outlines the specific postprocessing steps required to clean up and validate YAML files. Each step is designed to address a distinct aspect of YAML formatting or validation.

## Steps

### 1. Indentation Normalization
- **Purpose**: Ensure consistent indentation across YAML files, defaulting to 2 spaces.
- **High-Level Logic**:
  - Detect and correct inconsistent indentation (e.g., mixed spaces and tabs).
  - Normalize excessive or insufficient indentation.
  - Handle edge cases like empty files or files with only comments.

### 2. Required Fields Handling
- **Purpose**: Ensure all required fields are present with default values and remove invalid fields.
- **High-Level Logic**:
  - Add missing required fields with predefined default values.
  - Remove fields not defined in the schema.
  - Correct fields with invalid data types or structures.
  - Handle nested structures and edge cases like null or empty fields.

### 3. Syntax Validation
- **Purpose**: Validate and correct basic YAML syntax issues.
- **High-Level Logic**:
  - Use a YAML parser to detect syntax errors.
  - Correct simple issues (e.g., missing colons, minor indentation problems).
  - Flag unresolvable errors for manual review.
  - Handle edge cases like empty files or files with only comments.

## Next Steps
- Implement unit tests for each step following TDD.
- Develop the corresponding scripted steps.
- Integrate the steps into the PostprocessingPipeline.
