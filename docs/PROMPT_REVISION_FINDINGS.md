# Prompt Revision Findings - 2025-06-03

## Summary

We've completed an extensive analysis of prompt revision strategies for AIWhisperer, focusing on achieving extreme conciseness similar to Claude, ChatGPT, and Manus systems.

## Key Findings

### 1. Tool Output Formatting is the Root Cause

The issue is NOT with the prompts themselves, but with how tool results are presented to the AI:

```python
# ai_whisperer/services/execution/ai_loop.py:592
formatted_result = f"\n\nðŸ”§ **{tool_name}** executed:\n{str(tool_result)}"
```

This line was added for debugging and converts entire tool outputs to strings, which Alice then includes verbatim in her responses.

### 2. Manus Architecture Insights

Manus separates concerns elegantly:
- Tools do one thing and return minimal data
- Separate tools for execution vs. viewing results
- AI controls what gets shown to users
- Example: `shell_exec` runs commands, `shell_view` shows output

### 3. Prompt Improvements Are Valuable But Insufficient

Even with very explicit instructions like:
- "NEVER show raw tool output in FINAL"
- "Extract 2-3 key facts ONLY"
- Specific examples of right/wrong behavior

Alice still shows the entire JSON because that's what the system gives her.

## Recommendations

### Short Term (Quick Fix)
1. Remove the debug output from ai_loop.py
2. Have tools return structured data that AI can process
3. Let the AI decide what to show based on context

### Medium Term (Better Architecture)
1. Implement tool result handlers that format output appropriately
2. Create a separation between tool execution and result display
3. Consider a "tool result summarizer" that preprocesses verbose outputs

### Long Term (Manus-style Refactor)
1. Split tools into execution and viewing components
2. Implement proper message/notification tools
3. Give AI more control over information flow

## Revised Prompts Created

Despite the system-level issue, we created improved prompts with:
- Structured agent loops (ANALYZE â†’ PLAN â†’ EXECUTE â†’ EVALUATE â†’ ITERATE)
- Channel enforcement rules
- Extreme conciseness guidelines
- Clear examples of proper behavior

These are ready to use once the tool output issue is resolved.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the tool output formatting in ai_loop.py
2. Test the revised prompts with proper tool output handling
3. Consider implementing a tool result abstraction layer
4. Run full A/B testing suite to validate improvements

## Files Modified

- `/prompts/agents/alice_assistant_revised.prompt.md` - Revised Alice prompt
- `/prompts/shared/core_revised.md` - Revised core guidelines
- `/prompts/shared/tool_guidelines_revised.md` - Tool selection matrix
- `/scripts/alice_prompt_testing/` - A/B testing framework
- `/docs/PROMPT_REVISION_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed analysis document

## Conclusion

The prompt revision exercise was valuable for understanding best practices, but the real issue is architectural. AIWhisperer needs to evolve its tool system to give AI agents more control over what information is presented to users, similar to how Manus handles tool interactions.
