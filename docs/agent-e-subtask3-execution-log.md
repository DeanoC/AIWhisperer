# Agent E Subtask 3 Execution Log

## Task: Design Agent E core data structures
**Started**: 2025-05-31
**Status**: In Progress

## Purpose
Define JSON schemas for task representation, agent communication protocols, and plan hierarchy structures based on our understanding of AIWhisperer architecture and external agent requirements.

## Execution Process

### Initial Analysis
Based on previous research:
- AIWhisperer uses JSON for plans and tasks
- External agents need self-contained task descriptions
- Agent E must support hierarchical planning with Agent P
- Tasks need metadata for external agent optimization

### Tool Usage Log

#### 1. Read Tool - Existing Subtask Schema
**Tool**: Read
**Target**: schemas/subtask_schema.json
**Purpose**: Understand current task structure in AIWhisperer
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- Current schema includes: name, description, instructions, artifacts, constraints
- Has validation_criteria and depends_on for dependencies
- Uses UUIDs for task and subtask IDs
- Includes model_preference for AI model selection

#### 2. Read Tool - Plan Generation Schema
**Tool**: Read
**Target**: schemas/plan_generation_schema.json
**Purpose**: Understand how plans are structured
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- Plans organized by TDD phases (red, green, refactor)
- Tasks have agent_type classification
- Dependencies tracked between tasks
- Overall validation criteria for plan success

#### 3. Read Tool - RFC Reference Schema
**Tool**: Read
**Target**: schemas/rfc_reference_schema.json
**Purpose**: Understand RFC-Plan linking structure
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- Tracks RFC ID, path, and content hash
- Maintains sync history between RFC and plan
- Enables bidirectional updates

#### 4. Grep Tool - Search for Decomposition Patterns
**Tool**: Grep
**Pattern**: DecomposedTask|task.*decompos|agent.*communication
**Purpose**: Find existing decomposition or communication patterns
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Finding**: No existing decomposition structures found - Agent E will introduce these

#### 5. Read Tool - Message Models
**Tool**: Read
**Target**: interactive_server/message_models.py
**Purpose**: Understand communication patterns in AIWhisperer
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- WebSocket JSON-RPC communication model
- Tool call notifications and session management
- Status tracking with enums

#### 6. Write Tool - Data Structures Design Document
**Tool**: Write
**Target**: docs/agent-e-data-structures-design.md
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive design for Agent E data structures
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Created Structures**:
1. Decomposed Task Structure - For external agent execution
2. Agent Communication Protocol - For inter-agent messages
3. Task Execution Session - For tracking execution state
4. Plan Hierarchy Structure - For complex nested plans

### Design Decisions

#### 1. Decomposed Task Structure
- Extends existing task model with external agent specifics
- Includes prompts optimized for each agent type
- Tracks execution context and technology stack
- Maintains acceptance criteria with verification methods

#### 2. Agent Communication Protocol
- Message-based system for agent collaboration
- Supports various message types (requests, responses, updates)
- Maintains conversation context and threading
- Enables Agent E â†” Agent P collaboration

#### 3. Task Execution Session
- Tracks entire execution lifecycle
- Manages task dependencies as DAG
- Maintains execution queue and status
- Logs agent collaboration history

#### 4. Plan Hierarchy
- Supports nested plans for complex features
- Links sub-plans to parent tasks
- Tracks decomposition reasoning
- Enables recursive planning with Agent P

### Tools I Wished I Had

1. **Schema Validator**: To validate JSON schemas against examples
2. **Schema Relationship Visualizer**: To see how schemas connect
3. **Example Generator**: To create valid examples from schemas
4. **Schema Differ**: To compare with existing schemas for compatibility

### Context Preservation Strategy

- Created comprehensive design document as single source of truth
- Used existing schemas as foundation for compatibility
- Documented all design decisions and rationale
- Created example usage to clarify intent

### Validation Rules Established

1. **Task Rules**:
   - Unique IDs within session
   - Valid parent task references
   - Required context fields
   - Dependency DAG validation

2. **Communication Rules**:
   - Valid agent identifiers
   - Message threading
   - UTC timestamps
   - Session context preservation

3. **Execution Rules**:
   - State transition validation
   - Failure reason requirements
   - Dependency resolution checks

### Next Steps

With data structures designed, we can now:
1. Create JSON schema files for validation
2. Implement data models in Python
3. Write tests for data validation
4. Begin implementing Agent E core functionality
