# Agent E Subtask 2 Execution Log

## Task: Research external agent APIs and capabilities
**Started**: 2025-05-31
**Status**: In Progress

## Purpose
Deep dive into Claude Code, RooCode, and GitHub Copilot APIs to understand optimal prompt patterns, input formats, and integration approaches for Agent E's external agent integration feature.

## Execution Process

### Initial Status
Starting research on external agent capabilities and integration approaches. Since these are external services, I'll need to use web search and documentation analysis.

### Tool Usage Log

#### 1. Web Search - Claude Code Integration
**Time**: START
**Tool**: WebSearch
**Query**: Claude Code API integration documentation prompt patterns 2024
**Purpose**: Find information about Claude Code's capabilities and integration approach
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- Claude Code is a CLI tool, not a traditional API - it's a command-line interface for agentic coding
- Supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool integration
- Can be called via: `claude -p "<prompt>" --json | your_command` for pipelining
- Uses .mcp.json configuration files for project-specific settings
- Prompt templates can be stored in .claude/commands folder
- Best practice: Read files first before writing code
- GitHub integration available via claude-code-action

#### 2. Web Search - RooCode Integration
**Tool**: WebSearch
**Query**: RooCode API documentation integration 2024 Roo.ai
**Purpose**: Find information about RooCode's capabilities and integration approach
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- RooCode is a VS Code extension (formerly Roo Cline), not a traditional API
- Open source AI coding agent that supports multiple AI providers
- Uses API Configuration Profiles for switching between AI settings
- Supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) for custom tool integration
- Can execute terminal commands with permission-based controls
- Optimized for Claude 3.7 Sonnet model
- No direct API for external integration - works within VS Code environment

#### 3. Web Search - GitHub Copilot Agent Mode
**Tool**: WebSearch
**Query**: GitHub Copilot API integration agent mode 2024 documentation
**Purpose**: Find information about GitHub Copilot's agent mode capabilities
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- GitHub Copilot agent mode is an autonomous collaborator for multi-step coding tasks
- Available in VS Code (preview in Insiders, rolling out to stable)
- Can create apps, refactor across files, write tests, migrate code
- Works by iterating until task is complete, inferring necessary subtasks
- Uses defined tools: workspace search, file reading, terminal commands, error checking
- Supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) for extended functionality
- No traditional API - works within IDE environment with approval workflow
- Available in multiple IDEs: VS Code, Xcode, Eclipse, JetBrains, Visual Studio

#### 4. Web Search - Prompt Engineering Best Practices
**Tool**: WebSearch
**Query**: "prompt engineering" "coding agents" best practices 2024 Claude Copilot
**Purpose**: Understand optimal prompt patterns for coding agents
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- **Claude Code**: Test-driven development approach, codebase exploration, git operations
- **Best practice**: Ask to read files first, be explicit about TDD, avoid mock implementations
- **GitHub Copilot**: Provide sufficient context with related files open
- **General principles**: Be specific about language/framework, use meaningful names
- **Model preferences**: VS Code team prefers Claude Sonnet for agent mode
- **Advanced**: Use prompt templates in .claude/commands folder
- **Key pattern**: Progressive enhancement through prompt chaining

### Analysis Summary

#### Integration Approach Comparison

| Agent | Type | Integration Method | Key Features |
|-------|------|-------------------|--------------|
| Claude Code | CLI Tool | Command line + JSON output | MCP support, bash integration, prompt templates |
| RooCode | VS Code Extension | IDE integration | Open source, multi-provider support, MCP |
| GitHub Copilot | IDE Agent Mode | IDE integration | Autonomous iteration, tool-based approach |

#### Common Patterns Discovered

1. **No Traditional APIs**: All three are IDE/CLI-based tools, not REST APIs
2. **Human-in-the-Middle**: All require human approval for changes
3. **MCP Support**: Both Claude Code and RooCode support Model Context Protocol
4. **Tool-Based Architecture**: All use defined tools for file operations, terminal commands
5. **Iterative Approach**: Agents iterate until task completion

### Tools I Wished I Had

1. **API Documentation Fetcher**: Direct access to official API docs without web search
2. **Code Example Extractor**: Tool to find real-world usage examples
3. **Feature Comparison Matrix Generator**: Automated comparison of agent capabilities
4. **Integration Pattern Analyzer**: Tool to identify common integration patterns

### Context Preservation Strategy

- Creating progressive summaries after each search
- Building comparison tables for quick reference
- Documenting common patterns across all agents
- Saving key quotes and specific implementation details

### Implications for Agent E Design

Based on this research, Agent E should:

1. **Package tasks as self-contained prompts** with:
   - Clear context and file references
   - Specific language/framework requirements
   - Expected outcomes and test criteria

2. **Format tasks for CLI execution**:
   - Claude Code: `claude -p "<task>" --json`
   - RooCode/Copilot: Structured prompts for IDE chat

3. **Include metadata for each agent type**:
   - Recommended model (e.g., Claude Sonnet for complex tasks)
   - Tool permissions needed
   - File context requirements

4. **Follow TDD patterns**:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement to pass tests
   - Iterate based on results

### Next Steps

With this research complete, we now understand:
- None of these are traditional APIs - they're all IDE/CLI tools
- Integration will be through formatted prompts and task descriptions
- Human oversight is required for all external agents
- MCP could be a future integration point for deeper connectivity
