# /clear Command Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a `/clear` command for AIWhisperer's interactive mode that allows users to clear agent context without restarting sessions. This addresses the lack of context management features and provides a foundation for future conversation persistence.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Command Handler System
Added command handling to `StatelessInteractiveSession`:
- Commands starting with `/` are intercepted before agent processing
- `_handle_command()` method processes commands
- `_send_system_message()` method sends feedback to users

### 2. /clear Command Features
- `/clear` - Clears context for the current active agent
- `/clear <agent>` - Clears context for a specific agent (e.g., `/clear patricia`)
- `/clear all` - Clears context for all agents in the session
- `/help` - Shows available commands

### 3. Context Clearing Implementation
- Added `clear_agent_context()` method to `StatelessInteractiveSession`
- Added `clear_agent_context()` method to `AgentContextManager`
- Clears both context manager items and agent's internal context
- Sends notifications to client for UI updates

### 4. User Experience
- System messages appear in chat as responses from "system" agent
- Clear feedback on number of items cleared
- Error handling for unknown agents
- Help command for discoverability

## Code Changes

### Modified Files
1. `interactive_server/stateless_session_manager.py`:
   - Added command handling in `send_user_message()`
   - Added `_handle_command()` method
   - Added `clear_agent_context()` method
   - Added `_send_system_message()` method

2. `ai_whisperer/context/context_manager.py`:
   - Added `clear_agent_context()` method

### New Files
1. `tests/unit/test_clear_command.py`:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for /clear functionality
   - Tests all command variations
   - Tests error cases

2. `docs/clear-command-implementation-summary.md`:
   - This documentation file

## Testing
All tests pass successfully:
- 9 unit tests covering all /clear variations
- Tests for error handling
- Tests for system message formatting
- Integration with context manager

## Future Enhancements
This implementation provides a foundation for:
1. Additional commands (e.g., `/save`, `/load`, `/history`)
2. Context size limits and auto-compaction
3. Conversation persistence features
4. More granular context control (clear specific files, time ranges)

## Usage Examples
```
User: /clear
System: Cleared 5 context items for agent alice

User: /clear patricia
System: Cleared 3 context items for agent patricia

User: /clear all
System: Cleared context for all agents (12 items total)

User: /help
System: Available commands:
• /clear - Clear context for current agent
• /clear <agent> - Clear context for specific agent
• /clear all - Clear context for all agents
• /help - Show this help message
```

## Next Steps
With the /clear command implemented, the next logical step is implementing conversation persistence:
1. Auto-save sessions at intervals
2. Session recovery on reconnect
3. Conversation history browsing
4. Export/import functionality
