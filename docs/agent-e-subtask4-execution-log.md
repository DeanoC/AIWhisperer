# Agent E Subtask 4 Execution Log

## Task: Write tests for task decomposition engine
**Started**: 2025-05-31
**Status**: In Progress

## Purpose
Create comprehensive unit tests for the core task decomposition functionality, following TDD principles. Tests should cover plan parsing, task generation, dependency resolution, and external agent prompt generation.

## Execution Process

### Initial Analysis
Following TDD (Red-Green-Refactor):
- Write failing tests first
- Tests should define expected behavior
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure tests are comprehensive before implementation

### Tool Usage Log

#### 1. LS Tool - Check test directory structure
**Tool**: LS
**Target**: tests/unit/
**Purpose**: Understand existing test organization
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Finding**: Well-organized test structure with agent, tool, and component tests

#### 2. Read Tool - Example Agent Test
**Tool**: Read
**Target**: tests/unit/test_agent_stateless.py
**Purpose**: Understand testing patterns for agents
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Key Findings**:
- Uses pytest with fixtures for mocking
- Tests stateless agent with mock AI loop
- Follows standard Python testing patterns
- Uses AsyncMock for async methods

#### 3. Write Tool - Task Decomposition Tests
**Tool**: Write
**Target**: tests/unit/test_agent_e_task_decomposition.py
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive tests for task decomposition engine
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Tests Created**:
- TaskDecomposer initialization and basic functionality
- Plan decomposition into executable tasks
- External agent prompt generation
- Dependency resolution and cycle detection
- Technology stack detection
- Acceptance criteria generation
- Complexity estimation

#### 4. Write Tool - Agent Communication Tests
**Tool**: Write
**Target**: tests/unit/test_agent_e_communication.py
**Purpose**: Create tests for Agent E â†” Agent P communication
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Tests Created**:
- Clarification request/response flow
- Hierarchical planning requests
- Sub-RFC creation handling
- Bidirectional context sharing
- Message correlation and error handling
- Collaborative refinement sessions

### Key Design Decisions from Tests

#### 1. Task Decomposition Approach
- Each plan task becomes one or more decomposed tasks
- Tasks maintain parent reference for traceability
- External agent prompts generated per task
- Technology detection from descriptions
- Complexity estimation guides agent selection

#### 2. Communication Protocol
- Message-based async communication
- Correlation IDs for request/response matching
- Support for various message types
- Context preservation across messages
- Error handling with retry logic

#### 3. Test Coverage Strategy
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for agent collaboration
- Edge case coverage (cycles, errors)
- Mock external dependencies
- Async test support throughout

### TDD Benefits Realized

1. **Clear API Design**: Writing tests first defined the public API
2. **Error Cases**: Identified error scenarios before implementation
3. **Dependency Management**: Clear understanding of component dependencies
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples

### Tools I Wished I Had

1. **Test Generator**: Generate test cases from schemas
2. **Mock Builder**: Automatically create mocks from interfaces
3. **Test Coverage Analyzer**: Real-time coverage feedback
4. **Async Test Helper**: Better async testing utilities

### Next Steps

With comprehensive tests in place (RED phase), we can now:
1. Implement TaskDecomposer class
2. Implement AgentEHandler for communication
3. Implement data models
4. Run tests to verify implementation (GREEN phase)
