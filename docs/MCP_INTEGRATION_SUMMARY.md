# MCP Integration Planning Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the planning work completed for integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) support into AIWhisperer.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. MCP Integration Plan (`MCP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`)
A comprehensive overview covering:
- MCP protocol overview
- High-level architecture design
- Integration approach with existing tool system
- Configuration examples
- Implementation phases and timeline
- Benefits and success metrics

### 2. MCP Server Technical Design (`MCP_SERVER_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`)
Detailed technical design for the server component:
- Core server implementation with protocol handlers
- Tool exposure mechanism and format conversion
- Resource management with security controls
- Transport layers (stdio and WebSocket)
- Integration with AIWhisperer's tool registry
- Testing strategy and deployment approach

### 3. MCP Client Technical Design (`MCP_CLIENT_TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`)
Detailed technical design for the client component:
- Client implementation with transport abstraction
- Tool discovery and adapter pattern
- Connection pooling and reconnection logic
- Registry integration for seamless tool access
- Agent-specific permissions and configuration
- Monitoring and error handling

### 4. RFC Document (`RFC_MCP_INTEGRATION.md`)
Formal RFC proposing the integration:
- Executive summary and motivation
- Architectural overview
- Implementation plan with phases
- Backwards compatibility guarantees
- Security considerations
- Performance analysis
- Success criteria

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual Implementation**: Both server and client components for maximum flexibility
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Clean integration with existing AIWhisperer tool system
3. **Transport Flexibility**: Support for both stdio (Claude Code) and WebSocket
4. **Security First**: Tool allowlisting, path restrictions, and agent permissions
5. **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling, caching, and async execution
6. **Backwards Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approval**: Get team feedback on the RFC
2. **Prototype Development**: Start with Phase 1 (MCP Client)
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Set up test MCP servers
4. **Documentation**: Create user guides and tutorials
5. **Community Engagement**: Share plans with MCP community

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: MCP Client (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: MCP Server (2-3 weeks)  
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation (1-2 weeks)

Total estimated time: 7-11 weeks for full implementation

## Repository Structure

Proposed new directories:
```
ai_whisperer/mcp/
├── client/          # MCP client implementation
├── server/          # MCP server implementation
├── common/          # Shared utilities
└── examples/        # Example configurations
```

## Conclusion

The MCP integration will significantly enhance AIWhisperer's capabilities by:
- Enabling seamless Claude Code integration
- Providing access to the growing MCP tool ecosystem
- Maintaining full backwards compatibility
- Following security and performance best practices

All planning documents have been created and are ready for review and implementation.
