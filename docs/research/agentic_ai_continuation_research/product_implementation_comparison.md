# Implementation of Multi-Message Flows in AI Products

This document analyzes how Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Manus.im implement multi-message flows and continuation without requiring user input at each step.

## Claude (Anthropic)

### Implementation Approach

Claude implements multi-message flows through a combination of API features and system-level orchestration:

1. **Extended Thinking**: Claude's API provides native support for "interleaved thinking" where the model can:
   - Reason about tool call results before deciding next steps
   - Chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps in between
   - Maintain context across multiple interactions

2. **System-Level Orchestration**:
   - The Claude system manages the execution loop
   - Handles tool execution and result incorporation
   - Maintains conversation state across multiple interactions

From Anthropic's documentation: "With interleaved thinking, Claude can reason about the results of a tool call before deciding what to do next [and] chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps."

### Key Technical Components

1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:
   - Standardizes integration with diverse data sources
   - Enhances performance across different contexts
   - Maintains coherence across multi-step interactions

2. **Think Tool**:
   - Enables explicit reasoning steps
   - Improves agentic tool use
   - Supports multi-step planning

3. **Stateful Conversation Management**:
   - The system maintains conversation history
   - Tracks tool usage and results
   - Preserves context across multiple interactions

## GitHub Copilot

### Implementation Approach

GitHub Copilot, especially with its agent mode, implements multi-message flows primarily at the system level:

1. **Agent Mode**:
   - Introduced in February 2025
   - Acts as an "autonomous peer programmer"
   - Performs multi-step coding tasks without constant user input

2. **System-Level Orchestration**:
   - Manages context across the entire project
   - Coordinates between different tools and actions
   - Maintains state across multiple interactions

From GitHub's documentation: "Copilot agent mode is the next evolution in AI-assisted coding. Acting as an autonomous peer programmer, it performs multi-step coding tasks at your command."

### Key Technical Components

1. **Agentic Coding Flow**:
   - Autonomously invokes multiple tools
   - Plans and implements code without user intervention
   - Maintains context across multiple steps

2. **Task-Oriented Architecture**:
   - Organizes work around specific tasks
   - Generates editable plans of action
   - Executes plans step by step

3. **Project-Wide Context Management**:
   - Accesses and understands multiple files
   - Maintains awareness of project structure
   - Preserves context across different coding sessions

4. **Claude Integration**:
   - When using Claude models, leverages Claude's thinking capabilities
   - Maintains consistent behavior across different underlying models
   - System handles the orchestration regardless of model

## Manus.im

### Implementation Approach

Manus.im implements multi-message flows through a sophisticated sandbox environment:

1. **Container-Based Sandbox**:
   - Provides a secure, isolated space for AI agents
   - Enables interaction with various tools and systems
   - Maintains state across multiple interactions

2. **System-Level Orchestration**:
   - Manages the execution loop
   - Handles tool execution and result incorporation
   - Maintains conversation state

From Manus documentation: "Manus Sandbox is a container-based environment that provides a secure, isolated space for AI agents (particularly LLMs like Claude) to interact."

### Key Technical Components

1. **Sandbox Environment**:
   - Containerized execution environment
   - Secure access to tools and resources
   - Persistent state across multiple interactions

2. **Tool Orchestration**:
   - Manages access to various tools
   - Handles tool execution and result incorporation
   - Coordinates between different tools

3. **State Management**:
   - Maintains conversation history
   - Tracks tool usage and results
   - Preserves context across multiple interactions

## Comparative Analysis

| Feature | Claude | GitHub Copilot | Manus.im |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Primary Orchestration Level | System with API support | System | System |
| Native Thinking Capabilities | Yes (interleaved thinking) | Depends on model | Depends on model |
| Tool Integration | Native API support | System-level | System-level |
| State Management | Both API and system | System | System |
| Context Preservation | Both API and system | System | System |
| Execution Environment | Cloud-based | IDE integration | Container-based sandbox |

## Common Patterns

Despite their differences, these products share several common implementation patterns:

1. **Stateful Conversation Management**:
   - All maintain conversation history
   - All track tool usage and results
   - All preserve context across multiple interactions

2. **Tool Orchestration**:
   - All manage access to various tools
   - All handle tool execution and result incorporation
   - All coordinate between different tools

3. **System-Level Control Flow**:
   - All implement the main execution loop at the system level
   - All decide when to continue or terminate flows
   - All handle errors and edge cases

## Conclusion

While Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Manus.im leverage API-level capabilities where available, the seamless multi-message flows and continuation without user input are primarily achieved through sophisticated system-level orchestration. This orchestration manages state, coordinates tool usage, and maintains context across multiple interactions, creating the illusion of a continuous, autonomous agent even when the underlying API might require explicit continuation signals.
