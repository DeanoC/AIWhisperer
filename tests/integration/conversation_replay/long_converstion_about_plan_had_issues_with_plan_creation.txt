âœ“ Switched to Patricia the Planner
I want to create an RFC for asynchronous agents feature

21:19
RFC-2025-06-04-0001 for 'Asynchronous Agents Feature' has been created.
To refine this RFC, please clarify:

What specific functionalities will asynchronous agents enable?
What existing components will need refactoring?
What are the expected acceptance criteria?
21:20
Async agents will enable multiple seperates tasks to be run at the same time. They will optionally be able to sleep and wake to monitor activites and other agents

21:21
RFC updated with concurrent task execution and sleep/wake monitoring. Next, please clarify:

Which existing components will require refactoring for asynchronicity?
What mechanisms will be used for agents to 'sleep, wake, and monitor'?
What are the specific acceptance criteria for this feature?

21:21
The backend ai loops have already refactored to be 1 per agent, but now we will have extend to multiple ones running at the same time. The frontend UI will need updating to allow both group chats and 1-1 chats with particular agents. The mailbox system will need to be improved to support messages async agents. @docs/FUTURE_IDEAS.md contains a basic design of some features. Some tools may be made concurrently safe.

21:24
RFC updated with refactoring details and conceptual framework. To finalize, please specify:

Concrete acceptance criteria for concurrent tasks, agent sleep/wake, and UI/mailbox improvements.
How will conflict resolution for shared resources be handled?
What are the strategies for error handling and debugging in multi-agent interactions?
Show less
21:24
Acceptance criters for concurrent tasks will be that stay isolated from each other except vis specific tools (like the mallbox), for sleep/wake acceptable would a periodic function maybe something like debbie monitoring the system every 30 mins?
UI and mailbox will involve some design work
Shared resources will have to have auto pausing for small opereations with an optional locking protocol for longer use.
Error and debugging needs a design

RFC updated with acceptance criteria and shared resource management details. The RFC is now sufficiently clear. I will now proceed to prepare and generate the execution plan.

ok

21:28
ok

21:28
Generating the execution plan for 'Asynchronous Agents Feature' based on the RFC. This will include tasks for testing, implementation, and refinement.

21:29
ok

21:29
There was an issue saving the plan. I'm regenerating it with the correct structure now.

21:29
ok

21:30
continue

21:30
Correction: The plan save failed due to a missing task name. I'm fixing that and trying again.

21:32
The execution plan for 'Asynchronous Agents Feature' has been successfully generated and saved as 'async-agents-plan-2025-06-04'.
It contains 16 tasks, broken down into 5 Red (Test), 8 Green (Implementation), and 3 Refactor tasks.

21:32
can you show me it please?

Here is the execution plan for 'Asynchronous Agents Feature':

Plan: Asynchronous Agents Feature
Overview: Implement asynchronous capabilities for agents, enabling concurrent task execution, agent sleep/wake cycles, and enhanced inter-agent communication via an improved mailbox system. This includes refactoring existing AI loops and updating the frontend UI.

Milestones:

Core Asynchronous Agent Framework
Mailbox & UI Enhancements
Shared Resource Management & Error Handling
Validation Criteria:

Concurrent tasks remain isolated except via specific tools.
Agents can sleep and wake based on periodic functions.
UI supports group and 1-1 chats.
Mailbox handles asynchronous agent messages.
Shared resources use auto-pausing for small operations and optional locking for longer ones.
