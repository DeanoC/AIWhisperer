  "description": "This subtask instructs the AI to execute the Python script 'generate_squares.py' (located in 'project_dev/in_dev/add_1st_runner_test/current_test_plan/') that was generated in the preceding subtask. The execution must use the 'execute_command' tool. This script execution is expected to create/update the 'test.txt' file in the same directory.",
  "instructions": [
    "Utilize the 'execute_command' tool to run the Python script 'generate_squares.py'.",
    "For the 'execute_command' tool, set the 'command' parameter to 'python'.",
    "Set the 'args' parameter to a list containing the script name: ['generate_squares.py'].",
    "Set the 'cwd' (current working directory) parameter for 'execute_command' to 'project_dev/in_dev/add_1st_runner_test/current_test_plan/' to ensure the script runs in the correct context and 'test.txt' is created there."
