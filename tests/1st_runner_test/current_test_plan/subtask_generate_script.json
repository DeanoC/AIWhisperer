  "description": "This subtask instructs the AI to generate a Python script. The script should calculate the squares of integers from 1 to 10 and write each square to a new line in a file named 'test.txt'. The generated script should be saved as 'generate_squares.py' in the 'project_dev/in_dev/add_1st_runner_test/current_test_plan/' directory.",
  "instructions": [
    "Create a Python 3 script.",
    "The script must define logic to calculate the square of each integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive).",
    "The script must write each calculated square to a file named 'test.txt' in the 'project_dev/in_dev/add_1st_runner_test/current_test_plan/' directory.",
    "Each square written to 'test.txt' must be on a new line.",
    "Save the generated Python script as 'generate_squares.py' in the 'project_dev/in_dev/add_1st_runner_test/current_test_plan/' directory."
