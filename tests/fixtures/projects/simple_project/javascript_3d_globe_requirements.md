# Interactive 3D Globe Feature Requirements

This document outlines the functional requirements for a single-page static website that displays an interactive 3D globe. These requirements are written from the perspective of an external user or tester interacting with the feature.

## 1. Accessing the Website

The user can access the interactive 3D globe by opening the main HTML file in a standard web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge). No special software or server setup should be required to view the basic globe.

## 2. Visual Appearance

*   The page displays a prominent visual representation of a globe.
*   The globe should appear spherical and exhibit a sense of three-dimensional depth.
*   (Optional) The globe may display a basic texture or visual representation that suggests continents or landmasses. A simple, smooth sphere is also acceptable.

## 3. Interactivity

*   The user can interact with the globe using a mouse.
*   Clicking and dragging the mouse on the globe allows the user to rotate it freely in any direction (horizontal and vertical rotation).
*   The rotation should feel responsive and follow the user's mouse movements.
*   (Optional) If markers are present on the globe:
    *   Hovering the mouse cursor over a marker displays a small tooltip or label identifying the marker.
    *   Clicking on a marker may display more detailed information about that point of interest in a designated area on the page, without navigating away from the page.

## 4. Performance

*   The interactive rotation of the globe should be reasonably smooth and fluid on a typical desktop web browser.

## 5. Static Website

*   The feature is implemented entirely on the client-side using standard web technologies.
*   No server-side processing or database is required for the core functionality of displaying and rotating the globe.
