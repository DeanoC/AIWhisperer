# Python Text Adventure Game Requirements

This document outlines the functional requirements for a simple text-based adventure game, as experienced by a user or tester.

## 1. Program Invocation

The game should be runnable from a command-line interface. A typical invocation would be:

```bash
python <program_name>
```

Where `<program_name>` is the name of the Python script containing the game.

## 2. Game Start

Upon starting the program, the user should see:
*   An introductory message welcoming them to the game.
*   A description of the initial location they are in.

## 3. Player Input and Commands

The game should accept text input from the player. The player should be able to enter commands to interact with the game world. Expected commands include, but are not limited to:

*   `look`: Display the description of the current location again.
*   `go <direction>`: Attempt to move in a specified direction (e.g., `go north`, `go east`). Valid directions depend on the current location.
*   `enter <location_name>`: Attempt to move to a specific named location (e.g., `enter cave`). Valid location names depend on the current location.
*   `take <item>`: Attempt to pick up an item in the current location.

Commands should be case-insensitive (e.g., "Go North" should be treated the same as "go north").

## 4. Game World and Interaction

*   **Locations:** The game world consists of distinct locations (e.g., a forest, a cave). Each location has a unique description.
*   **Movement:** The player can move between connected locations using the `go` or `enter` commands.
    *   If a movement command is valid for the current location, the game should display the description of the new location.
    *   If a movement command is invalid (e.g., trying to go north from a location with no northern exit), the game should provide feedback indicating that movement in that direction is not possible.
*   **Interaction:** The game should respond to valid commands based on the current location and game state.

## 5. Goal/End Condition

The game should have a clear objective or end condition. For example, the game could end when the player finds a specific item in one of the locations. Upon achieving the goal, the game should display a winning message and terminate.

## 6. Error Handling

If the player enters a command that is not recognized or is not valid in the current context, the game should provide feedback, such as:

```
Unknown command.
```

or a similar informative message. The game should then prompt the player for the next command.
