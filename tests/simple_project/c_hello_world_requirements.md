# C "Hello, World!" Application Requirements

This document outlines the functional requirements for a simple C application from the perspective of an external user or tester.

## 1. Program Compilation and Invocation

The application is provided as a C source file. To use the application, a user must first compile the source file using a standard C compiler (e.g., GCC).

The typical compilation command would be:

```bash
gcc -o <executable_name> <source_file.c>
```

Where:
- `<executable_name>` is the desired name for the compiled executable file.
- `<source_file.c>` is the name of the provided C source file.

After successful compilation, the resulting executable can be run from the command line.

The typical invocation command would be:

```bash
./<executable_name>
```

## 2. Expected Output

Upon successful execution, the application shall print the exact string "Hello, World!" to the standard output (console).

The output should appear as follows:

```
Hello, World!
```

## 3. Error Conditions

If the program is compiled successfully and executed in a standard environment, no runtime errors are expected.

Potential issues during the compilation phase may include:
- The absence of a C compiler in the execution environment.
- Issues within the provided C source file that prevent successful compilation.
