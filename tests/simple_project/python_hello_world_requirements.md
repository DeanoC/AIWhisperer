# Functional Requirements: Python "Hello, World!"

This document outlines the functional requirements for a simple Python application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. These requirements are described from the perspective of an external user.

## 1. Program Invocation

The application should be executable from a command-line interface. A user should be able to run the program by invoking the Python interpreter followed by the program file.

Example command:
```bash
python <program_file>
```
*(Note: <program_file> represents the name of the file containing the application code.)*

## 2. Expected Output

Upon successful execution, the application must print the exact string "Hello, World!" to the standard output (the console).

The output should appear exactly as follows:
```
Hello, World!
```

## 3. Error Conditions

Assuming a correctly configured Python environment and a valid program file, no errors are expected during the execution of this application.
