# JavaScript "Hello, World!" Application Requirements

This document outlines the functional requirements for a simple JavaScript application from the perspective of an external user.

## 1. Program Invocation

The application is expected to be executed within a standard JavaScript environment. This could typically involve:

*   Loading the program within a web browser environment, where the output would be observed in the browser's developer console.
*   Executing the program using a JavaScript runtime environment, such as Node.js, via a command-line interface.

The specific method of execution may vary depending on the environment, but the outcome should be consistent.

## 2. Expected Output

Upon successful execution, the application must produce the exact string "Hello, World!".

This output should be visible in the standard output stream or the console associated with the execution environment (e.g., the terminal for Node.js or the developer console in a web browser).

## 3. Error Conditions

Under normal operating conditions and with a correctly configured JavaScript environment, the application is not expected to produce any error messages or exceptions.
