# Retro Style Static Website Requirements

This document outlines the functional requirements for a simple, single-page static website designed with a retro aesthetic, reminiscent of early personal computer interfaces or 1980s video games.

## 1. Accessing the Website

The user should be able to view the website by opening the main document file in a standard web browser. No server setup or special installation should be required.

## 2. Visual Appearance (Retro Theme)

The website should visually convey a retro theme. This includes:
*   **Color Palette:** Use of bright, possibly neon, colors or a limited, high-contrast palette typical of older displays.
*   **Typography:** Employ fonts that mimic pixelated or early digital text styles.
*   **Layout:** Utilize simple, blocky layouts with clear divisions between content areas. Borders and backgrounds should contribute to the retro feel.

## 3. Content Elements

The website must display the following content:
*   **Title:** A prominent title at the top of the page.
*   **Text Content:** At least one paragraph of descriptive text.
*   **Image:** Inclusion of at least one image. The image itself or its presentation (e.g., bordered, low-resolution style) should align with the retro theme.

## 4. Interactive Element(s)

The website must include at least one interactive element that responds to user input:
*   **Element:** A clickable element, such as a button or a specific text area.
*   **Interaction:** Upon clicking the element, some visible change should occur on the page, such as altering the text content of a specific section or triggering a simple visual effect.

## 5. Responsiveness

The website should be viewable and functional within a typical desktop web browser window. Complex responsiveness for various screen sizes (e.g., mobile devices) is not required.

## 6. Static Nature

The website is entirely client-side. All content and interactivity are handled within the user's browser using standard web technologies. No server-side processing or database is involved.
