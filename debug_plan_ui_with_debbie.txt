Hi Debbie! I need your help debugging a plan UI issue. The frontend plan view isn't displaying plans properly, but I suspect the backend is working. Can you help me investigate?

Please test the plan listing functionality and see what data is available.

Can you also check what plan-related tools are available to you?

Please examine the plan data structure and format to see if there might be any issues with how the data is structured for the frontend.

If you find plans, can you show me the detailed structure of one plan so I can compare it with what the frontend expects?

Can you also check if there are any tools for plan details or plan viewing that the frontend might be trying to use?
